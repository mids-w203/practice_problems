  Scientists have recently become concerned about the safety of Teflon cookware and various food containers because perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) is used in the manufacturing process. An article in the July 27, 2005, New York Times reported that of 600 children tested, 96% had PFOA in their blood. According to the FDA, 90% of all Americans have PFOA in their blood.
  (a) Does the data on PFOA incidence among chil- dren suggest that the percentage of all children who have PFOA in their blood exceeds the FDA percentage for all Americans? Carry out an appropriate test of hypotheses.
  (b) If 95% of all children have PFOA in their blood, how likely is it that the null hypothesis tested in (a) will be rejected when a signifi- cance level of .01 is employed?
  (c) Referring back to (b),what sample size would be necessary for the relevant probability to be .10?
