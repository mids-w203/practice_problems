    Assume two events, $A$ and $B$ are independent ($A \perp B$).
    a) prove that $A^C$ and $B^C$ are independent.
    b) prove that $A$ and $B^C$ are independent.

(a) 
\\[
\begin{align}
P(A^C \cap B^C)&=1-P((A^C\cap B^C)^C),\text{ complement rule}\\\\\
&=1-P(A\cup B),\text{ De Morgan's law}\\\\\
&=1-[P(A)+P(B)-P(A\cap B)],\text{ addition rule}\\\\\
&=1-[P(A)+P(B)-P(A)P(B)],\text{ using independence}\\\\\
&=1-P(A)-P(B)+P(A)P(B)\\\\\
&=(1-P(A))(1-P(B))\\\\\
&=P(A^C)P(B^C),\text{ complement rule}
\end{align}
\\]
Hence, $A^C$ and $B^C$ are independent.


(b) 
We note first that $A$ is the union of the disjoint sets $(A\cap B^C)$ and $(A\cap B)$. By the addition rule, we then get
\\[
\begin{align}
&P(A)=P(A\cap B^C)+P(A\cap B)\\\\\
\implies &P(A)=P(A\cap B^C)+P(A)P(B),\text{ since independent}\\\\\
\implies &P(A \cap B^C)=P(A)-P(A)P(B)\\\\\
\implies &P(A\cap B^C)=P(A)(1-P(B))\\\\\
\implies &P(A\cap B^C)=P(A)P(B^C),\text{ complement rule}
\end{align}
\\]
Hence, $A$ and $B^C$ are independent. A similar argument will also show that $A^C$ and $B$ are independent.
