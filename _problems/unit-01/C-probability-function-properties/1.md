    Assume outcome space $\Omega = \{a,b\}$ (with the usual event space equal to the power set). Prove that the following function is not a valid probability function. \[\begin{align} P(\emptyset) &= 0\\ P(a) &= .5   \\ P(b) &= .4 \\ P(\Omega) = 1 \end{align}\]

The given axiom fails the countable additivity axiom. Let event $A = {a}$ and event $B = {b}$. The set $\{A,B\}$ has just two elements, so it is countable. By countable additivity, $P( \Omega ) = P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B) = .5 + .4 = .9$. But $P(\Omega) = 1$, which is a contradiction. Therefore, $P$ is not a valid probability function.
