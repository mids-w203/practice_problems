    Assume an outcome space consisting of all positive integers, $\Omega = \{1,2,3,...\}$, and a probability function $P$ defined on the power set. Prove that it is not possible for the probability of every integer to be equal. That is it is not possible that $P(\{a\}) = P(\{b\})$ for every pair of integers $a,b \in \{1,2,3,...\}$.

Assume for contradiction that there is a number $c \ge 0$ such that $P(\{a\}) = c$ for every integer $a$. The positive integers are countable, so by the countable additivity axiom, we know,

$$P(\Omega) = P( \{1\} \cup \{2\} \cup \{3\} \cup ...) = P( \{1\} ) + P( \{2\} ) + P( \{3\} ) + ... = c + c + c + ...$$

$P(\Omega) = 1$ by the unitarity axiom, so the infinite sum on the right must equal 1. However, if $c=0$ then the infinite sum equals zero, and if $c>0$ then the infinite sum us unbounded (and certainly bigger than 1). This is a contradiction, so it is not possible that all integers have the same probability.
