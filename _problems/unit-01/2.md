    Suppose we pick a number at random from the phone book and look at the last
    digit.
    
    (a) What is the set of outcomes and what probability should be assigned
    to each outcome?
    
    (b) Would this model be appropriate if we were looking at the
    first digit?
answer: $\frac{1}{10}$, NO

(a) The set of outcomes, $\Omega=\\{0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9\\}$.

If the number is picked at random, we may assume that the outcomes are
*equally-likely*. Therefore, each outcome will have an equal probability of
$\frac{1}{10}$.

(b) **No**. In this case, $0$ is not an outcome.
