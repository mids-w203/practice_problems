    If we flip a coin 5 times, what is the probability that the number of heads 
    is an even number (that is, divisible by 2)?
answer: $\frac{1}{2}$

In the random experiment of tossing a coin $5$ times, an example outcome is
$HTTHT$. Assuming that ***order matters***, the total number of outputs,
$|\Omega|=2.2.2.2.2=2^5=32$.

Let us denote by $E$ the event that the number of heads is an even number.
Therefore, it's complement, $E'$, denotes the event that number of heads is an
odd number. Note that our example output $HTTHT\in E$.

We claim that $E$ and $E'$ contain equal number of outcomes from $\Omega$, i.e.,
$\|E\|=\|E'\|$. Before we sketch why the claim is true, let us see the
consequences.

For this experiment, we assume that the outcomes are *equally-likes*,
consequently 
\\[P(E)=\frac{\|E\|}{\|\Omega\|}=\frac{\|E'\|}{\|\Omega\|}=P(E').\\]

Using the *complement rule*, we then get
\\[
    \begin{align}
    P(E)+P(E')&=1\\\\\
    \implies 2P(E)&=1,\text{ since }P(E)=P(E')\\\\\
    \implies P(E)&=\frac{1}{2}.
    \end{align}
\\]

**Proof of Claim:** To prove that $\|E\|=\|E\|$, it suffices to show that there
exists a bijective map/function $f:E\to E'$. We define $f$ to be the map that
flips $H\mapsto T$ and $T\mapsto H$ on each outcome. For instance,
$f(HTTHT)=THHTH$. One can check that $f$ is bijective.
