    Suppose $\Omega=\\{a,b,c\\}$, $P(\\{a,b\\})=0.7$, and $P(\\{b,c\\})=0.6$. Compute the probabilities of $\\{a\\}$, $\\{b\\}$, and $\\{c\\}$.
number: 16
answer: $0.4,0.3,0.3$

\\[
    \begin{align}
    P(\\{a\\})&=1-P(\\{a\\}'),\text{ Law of Complement }\\\\\
    &=1-P(\\{b,c\\})\\\\\
    &=1-0.6\\\\\
    &=0.4
    \end{align}    
\\]
Similarly, $P(\\{c\\})=0.3$.

\\[
    \begin{align}
    P(\\{b\\})&=P(\\{a,b\\}\cap\\{b,c\\})\\\\\
    &=P(\\{a,b\\})+P(\\{b,c\\})-P(\\{a,b\\}\cup\\{b,c\\})\\\\\
    &=P(\\{a,b\\})+P(\\{b,c\\})-P(\\{a,b,c\\})\\\\\
    &=0.7+0.6-1\\\\\
    &=0.3
    \end{align}
