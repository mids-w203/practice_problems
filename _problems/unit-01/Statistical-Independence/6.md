    Two students, Alice and Betty, are registered for a statistics class. Alice
    attends $80\%$ of the time, Betty $60\%$ of the time, and their absences are
    independent. On a given day, what is the probability that 
    (a) at least one of these students is in class
    (b) exactly one of them is there?
