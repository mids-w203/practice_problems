    An urn contains three red and two white balls. A ball is drawn, it and another ball of the same color are placed back in the urn. Finally, a second ball is drawn.  
    (a) What is the probability that the second ball drawn is white?  
    (b) If the second ball drawn is white, what is the probability that the first ball drawn was red?

Let us denote by $R$ the event that the first ball drawn was red, and by $W$ that the second ball is white. Since there are three red and two white balls to start with, we have
\\[
P(R)=\frac{3}{5}\mbox{ and } P(R^c)=\frac{2}{5}.
\\]

(a)
To find the $P(W)$, we realize for the second draw the conditional probabilities are easier to compute. The *law of total probability* can be a helpful friend in such a situation. Since both $P(R),P(R^c)>0$, we can write
\\[
P(W) = P(W|R)P(R) + P(W|R^c)P(R^c).
\\]

If the first ball was red, the ball is replaced, and a new red ball is added to the urn. So,    

$$P(W|R)=\frac{2}{5+1}=\frac{2}{6}=\frac{1}{3}.$$

Similarly, when the first draw was a white ball, 

$$P(W|R^c)=\frac{2+1}{5+1}=\frac{3}{6}=\frac{1}{2}.$$

Therefore,

$$P(W) = \frac{1}{3}\times\frac{3}{5}+\frac{1}{2}\times\frac{2}{5}=\frac{2}{5}.$$

(b) To compute $P(R\|W)$, we use *Bayes' Rule*

$$P(R|W)=\frac{P(W|R)P(R)}{P(W)}=\frac{\frac{1}{3}\times\frac{3}{5}}{\frac{2}{5}}=\frac{1}{2}.$$
