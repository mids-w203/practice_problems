    A box has three coins. One has two heads, one has two tails, and the other is a fair coin with one head and one tail. A coin is chosen at random, is flipped, and comes up heads.   
    (a) What is the probability that the coin chosen is the two-headed coin?  
    (b) What is the probability that if the same coin is thrown another time, it will come up heads?

To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' Theorem and the concept of conditional probability.

Let's define the events:
- $C_{hh}$: The coin chosen is the two-headed coin.
- $C_{tt}$: The coin chosen is the two-tailed coin.
- $C_{f}$: The coin chosen is the fair coin.
- $H$: The coin flip results in heads.

We want to find:

(a) $P(C_{hh}|H)$, the probability that the coin is the two-headed coin given that it landed on heads.

(b) The probability that the same coin will land on heads in the next flip.

**(a) Probability that the chosen coin is the two-headed coin $(P(A|H))$**

First, we find the probability of getting heads $(P(H))$. Since one coin always lands heads, one always lands tails, and one has a 50% chance of landing heads, $P(H)$ is calculated as follows:

- The two-headed coin always lands heads: $P(H|C_{hh}) = 1$
- The two-tailed coin never lands heads: $P(H|C_{tt}) = 0$
- The fair coin lands heads half the time: $P(H|C_{f}) = 0.5$

Since each coin is equally likely to be chosen, each has a $1/3$ probability of being chosen. Thus, $P(H)$ is:

\begin{align}
P(H) &= P(C_{hh}) \cdot P(H|C_{hh}) + P(C_{tt}) \cdot P(H|C_{tt}) + P(C_{f}) \cdot P(H|C_{f}) \\\\
&= \frac{1}{3} \cdot 1 + \frac{1}{3} \cdot 0 + \frac{1}{3} \cdot 0.5 \\\\
&= \frac{1}{3} + 0 + \frac{1}{6} \\\\
&= \frac{1}{2} 
\end{align}

Now, using Bayes' Theorem, P(A|H) is:
\begin{align}
P(C_{hh}|H) &= \frac{P(H|C_{hh}) \cdot P(C_{hh})}{P(H)} \\\\
& = \frac{1 \cdot \frac{1}{3}}{\frac{1}{2}} \\\\
& = \frac{1}{3} \times 2 \\\\
& = \frac{2}{3} 
\end{align}
So, the probability that the coin is the two-headed coin, given that it landed on heads, is 2/3.

**(b) Probability that the same coin will land on heads in the next flip**

Let's define the events:
- $H_{next}$: heads on next flip.

Given that the coin landed heads the first time, there are three possibilities:
1. It's the two-headed coin, which will always land heads.
2. It's the fair coin, which has a 50% chance of landing heads.
3. It's the two-tailed coin, which cannot be the case since we've observed heads.

We've already calculated that the probability of it being the two-headed coin is 2/3, and the probability of it being the fair coin is the remaining 1/3 (since the two-tailed coin is now impossible). Therefore, the probability of the coin landing heads on the next flip is:

\begin{align}
P(H_{next}) &= P(C_{hh}) \cdot P(H|C_{hh}) + P(C_{f}) \cdot P(H|C_{f}) \\\\
&= \frac{2}{3} \cdot 1 + \frac{1}{3} \cdot \frac{1}{2} \\\\
&= \frac{2}{3} + \frac{1}{6} \\\\
& = \frac{4}{6} + \frac{1}{6} \\\\
& = \frac{5}{6}
\end{align}

So, the probability that the same coin will land on heads in the next flip is 5/6.
