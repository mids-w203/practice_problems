    A box has three coins. One has two heads, one has two tails, and the other is a fair coin with one head and one tail. A coin is chosen at random, is flipped, and comes up heads.   
    (a) What is the probability that the coin chosen is the two-headed coin?  
    (b) What is the probability that if the same coin is thrown another time, it will come up heads?

To keep our notations simple, we denote the gifts by the initials of the children. The space of all possible outcomes, the sample space, can be represented as a set of ordered triplets $\Omega=\\{(A,B,C),(A,C,B),(B,C,A),(B,A,C),(C,A,B),(C,B,A)\\}$.

Since there are 6 outcomes, the size of the powerset is $2^6 = 64$.

Additional Notes:

The power set is the set of all possible subsets of the sample space. To give you a few examples, the following subsets are parts of the powerset:

$\\{(A,B,C),(A,C,B)\\}$

$\\{(B,C,A),(B,A,C),(C,A,B),(C,B,A)\\}$

$\\{(A,B,C),(A,C,B),(B,C,A),(B,A,C),(C,A,B),(C,B,A)\\}$

$\emptyset$

To understand the formula for the powerset, think about constructing a subset of outcomes. For each outcome, you have to decide whether to put it into the subset or leave it out. That's 6 different decisions, each one with two outcomes, so the total number of paths you can take is $2^6$.
