     In the following diagram of sample space $$\Omega$$, all angles are right angles, and the probability of each event is proportional to its area. Use the law of total probability to compute the value of $P(B)$: ![Area Diagram](/practice_problems/docs/assets/squares.jpg)

We observe that $$\{A_1,A_2\}$$ is a partition of  $$\Omega$$. Applying the law of total probability to this partition, 

$$P(B) = P(A_1)P(B|A_1) + P(A_2)P(B|A_2)$$

Notice that rectangles $$A_1$$ and $$A_2$$ have the same area, so $$P(A_1) = P(A_2) = 1/2$$. Rectangle $$B \cap A_1$$ has half the height of rectangle $A_1$ and the same width, so $$P(B|A_1) = P(B \cap A_1) / P(A_1) = 1/2$$. Rectangle $$B \cap A_2$$ has half the height and half the width of rectangle $$A_2$$, so $$P(B|A_2) = P(B \cap A_2) / P(A_2) = 1/4$$. Plugging these numbers into the law of total probability above, 

$$P(B) = (1/2)(1/2) + (1/2)(1/4) = 3/8$$
