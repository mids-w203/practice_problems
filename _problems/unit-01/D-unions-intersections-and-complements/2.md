    In a group of $320$ people, only $10$ are millionaires but $4$ of the $170$ college graduates are millionaires. How many non-college graduates are not millionaires?
answer: $144$
---
Let $\Omega$ denote the set of all $320$ people. Let $C$ and $M$
denote the set of people that went to college and the set of millionaires,
respectively. We have $\|\Omega\|=320$, $\|C\|=170$, $\|M\|=10$, and $\|C\cap M\|=4$.

We note that $M'\cap C'$ denotes the set of non-college graduates who are not millionaires.
Now,
\\[
    \begin{align}
    \|M'\cap C'\|&=\|(M\cup C)'\|\\\\\
    &=\|\Omega\|-\|(M\cup C)\|\\\\\
    &=\|\Omega\|-(\|M\|+\|C\|-\|M\cap C\|)\\\\\
    &=320-(10+170-4)\\\\\
    &=320-176\\\\\
    &=144.
    \end{align}
\\]
Therefore, $144$ non-college graduates are not millionaires.
