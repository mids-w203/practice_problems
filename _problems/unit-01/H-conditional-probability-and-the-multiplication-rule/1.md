    A fair coin is tossed three times.  
    (a) What is the conditional probability of two or more heads given that there was at least one head?  
    (b) What is the conditional probability given that there was at least on tail?

#### Let:

Throws will be named $Th_n$ 

#### Given: 
     
The throws are independent since the outcome is the result of thier unmodified probability.

# We could list all the possible events and count

#### a) The first toss is fixed as a head

There are three possible events, each with 1/2 * 1/2 = 1/4 probablity 
{HHT, HTT, HHH, HTH}

The three events where there are at least 2 heads are 
therfore 3/4 = %75


#### b) The first toss is fixed as a tail

{THT, TTT, THH, TTH) therefore P = 3/4 = 25%


# A more complete solution might be:

#### Given:

H=1 and T=0

Let: X be the number of heads X=$\sum(H)$

There are three tosses ($Th_1, Th_2, Th_3$)
        
$P(Th_1=1)$ is variable based on the question

$P(Th_2=1) = P(Th_3=1) = 1/2$

We will use the Addition rule: 

$P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - (P(A \cap B)$


### a) If at least one toss is a HEAD  $P(X>=2|Th_1=1)$

Then if one or both of the other flips are heads, we meet this condition

$P(X>=2) = P(X=2) \cup P(X=3) = P(Th_2=1) \cup P(Th_3=1)$

$P(Th__2=1 \cup Th__3=1) = P(Th__2=1) + P(Th__3=1) - (P(Th__2=1 \cap Th__3=1)$

$P(Th__2=1 \cup Th__3=1) = 1/2 + 1/2 - 1/4 = 3/4 = 75\%$

### b) If at least one toss is a TAIL  $P(X>=2|Th_1=0)$

Then both of the other flips have to be heads, to meet this condition.

$P(X>=2) = P(X=2) = P(Th_2=1 \cap Th_3=1)$

$P(Th_2=1 \cap Th_3=1) = P(Th_2=1) \cdot P(Th_3=1)$

$P(Th_2=1 \cap Th_3=1) = 1/2 \cdot 1/2 = 1/4 = 25\%$
