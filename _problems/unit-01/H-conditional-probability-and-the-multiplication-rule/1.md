    A fair coin is tossed three times.  
    (a) What is the conditional probability of two or more heads given that there was at least one head?  
    (b) What is the conditional probability given that there was at least on tail?

$Let:\ H_1$ be the event of at least one head

$Let:\ H_2$ be the event of at least two heads

$Let:\ T_1$ be the event of at least one Tail

#### a) at least one toss is fixed is a head

The problem is asking for $P(H_2|H_1)$; we will use the unconditioned probabilities to get the conditional probability

because the possible outcomes are {HHH, HHT, HTT, HTH, THH, THT, TTT, TTH}

Unconditioned Probabilities

$P(H_2) = 4/8$

$P(H_1) = 7/8$

$P(H_2|H_1) = P(H_1 \cap H_2) / P(H_1)$; by conditional probability

* We cannot use independence to get the numerator;
* conditioning on H_1 removes TTT and changes the event space.

$P(H_2|H_1) = (P(H_1| H_2) P(H_2))/ P(H_1)$;  Bayes' rule

* getting $P(H_1| H_2)$ is obviously 1; having H_2 requires H_1
  
$P(H_2|H_1) = (1* 4/8) / 7/$ 

$P(H_2|H_1) = 4/8 * 8/7 = /box 4/7$

We can verify this by looking at the conditional events  {HHH, HHT, HTT, HTH, THH, THT, TTH}  = 4/7

### b) If at least one toss is a TAIL
