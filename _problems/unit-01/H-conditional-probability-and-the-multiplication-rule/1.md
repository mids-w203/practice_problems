    A fair coin is tossed three times.  
    (a) What is the conditional probability of two or more heads given that there was at least one head?  
    (b) What is the conditional probability given that there was at least on tail?

$Let:\ H_1$ be the event of at least one head

$Let:\ H_2$ be the event of at least two heads

$Let:\ T_1$ be the event of at least one Tail

#### a) at least one toss is fixed is a head

The problem is asking for $P(H_2|H_1)$; we will use the unconditioned probabilities to get the conditional probability

because the possible outcomes are {HHH, HHT, HTT, HTH, THH, THT, TTT, TTH}

$P(H_2) = 4/8$

$P(H_1) = 7/8$

$P(H_2|H_1) = P(H_1 \cap H_2) / P(H_1)$; by definition of conditional probability

* If you know that there are at least 2 heads, you automatically know that there is at least one head, so $H_2 \subset H_1$. Therefore, $H_1 \cap H_2 = H_2$.

$P(H_2|H_1) =  P(H_2)/ P(H_1)$

$P(H_2|H_1) = 4/8 \cdot 8/7 = \frac{4}{7}$

We can verify this by looking at the outcomes in H_1 and counting the ones with at least two heads:  $\\{HHH, HHT, HTT, HTH, THH, THT, TTH\\} \rightarrow \frac{4}{7}$

### b) If at least one toss is a TAIL  

This problem is asking for $P(H_2|T_1)$; Use the logic above to get $P(T_1)$

$P(T_1) = 7/8$

$P(H_2|T_1) = P(T_1 \cap H_2) / P(T_1)$; by conditional probability

* We cannot use independence to get the numerator on the right side, because we do not know that $T_1$ and $H_2$ are independent. Instead, we count the outcomes in $T_1 \cap H_2$:

$$\\{THH, HTH, HHT\\}$$

There are three outcomes, because we know that there are two heads and one tail in three positions, and there are three places that the tail can go. Therefore,

$$P(T_1 \cap H_2) = 3/8$$

Plugging in above,

$$P(H_2|T_1) = \frac{3/8}{7/8} = \frac{3}{7}$$

We can verify this by looking at the event $T_1$ and counting how may outcomes include two heads:  $\\{TTT, HHT, HTT, HTH, THH, THT, TTH\\}  \rightarrow \frac{3}{7}$
