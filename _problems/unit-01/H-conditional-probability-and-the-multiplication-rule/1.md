    A fair coin is tossed three times.  
    (a) What is the conditional probability of two or more heads given that there was at least one head?  
    (b) What is the conditional probability given that there was at least on tail?

$Let:\ H_1$ be the event of at least one head

$Let:\ H_2$ be the event of at least two heads

$Let:\ T_1$ be the event of at least one Tail

#### a) at least one toss is fixed is a head

The problem is asking for $P(H_2|H_1)$; we will use the unconditioned probabilities to get the conditional probability

because the possible outcomes are {HHH, HHT, HTT, HTH, THH, THT, TTT, TTH}

$P(H_2) = 4/8$

$P(H_1) = 7/8$

$P(H_2|H_1) = P(H_1 \cap H_2) / P(H_1)$; by conditional probability

* We cannot use independence to get the numerator;
* conditioning on H_1 removes TTT and changes the event space.

$P(H_2|H_1) = (P(H_1| H_2) P(H_2))/ P(H_1)$;  Bayes' rule

* getting $P(H_1| H_2) = 1$ because having H_2 requires H_1
  
$P(H_2|H_1) = \frac{1 \cdot 4/8}{7/8}$ 

$P(H_2|H_1) = 4/8 \cdot 8/7 = \frac{4}{7}$

We can verify this by looking at the conditional events  {HHH, HHT, HTT, HTH, THH, THT, TTH} = $\frac{4}{7}$

{HHH, HHT, HTH, THH} 

### b) If at least one toss is a TAIL  

This problem is asking for $P(H_2|T_1)$; Use the logic above to get $T_1$

$P(T_1) = 7/8$

$P(H_2|T_1) = P(T_1 \cap H_2) / P(T_1)$; by conditional probability

* As before we cannot use independence to get the numerator on the right side

$P(H_2|T_1) = (P(T_1| H_2) P(H_2))/ P(T_1)$;  Bayes' rule

* There are 4 events with 2 heads; the tail can be any of three positions
* $P(T_1| H_2) = \frac{3}{4}$

$P(H_2|T_1) = \frac{3/4 \cdot 4/8}{7/8}$ 

$P(H_2|T_1) = \frac{3/8}{7/8}$ 

$P(H_2|T_1) = \frac{3}{7}$ 

We can verify this by looking at the conditional events  {TTT, HHT, HTT, HTH, THH, THT, TTH}  = $\frac{3}{7}$
