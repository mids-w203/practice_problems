    A fair coin is tossed three times.  
    (a) What is the conditional probability of two or more heads given that there was at least one head?  
    (b) What is the conditional probability given that there was at least on tail?
---


$Let: /H_1$ be the event of at least one head

$Let: /H_2$ be the event of at least two heads

$Let: /T_1$ be the event of at least one Tail

#### a) at least one toss is fixed is a head

$The problem is asking for P(H_2|H_1)$

$P(H_1) = 1$

because the outcomes are {HHH, HHT, HTT, HTH}

$P(H_2) = 3/4$


Use conditional probability:

$P(H_2|H_1) = P(H_1 \cap H_2) / P(H_1)$

$P(H_2|H_1) = (3/4* 1) / 1 = 3/4$

### b) If at least one toss is a TAIL  

The problem is asking for $P(H_2|T_1)$

$P(T_1) = 1$

because the outcomes are {THH, THT, TTT, TTH}

$P(H_2) = 1/4$

Use conditional probability:

$P(H_2|T_1) = P(T_1 \cap H_2) / P(T_1)$

$P(H_2|T_1) = (1/4* 1) / 1 = 1/4$
