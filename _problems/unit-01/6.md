    $20$ families live in a neighborhood: $4$ have $1$ child, $8$ have $2$ children, $5$ have $3$ children, and $3$ have $4$ children. If we pick a child at random, what is the probability that they come from a family with $1, 2, 3, 4$ children?
answer: $\frac{4}{47},\frac{16}{47},\frac{15}{47,}\frac{12}{47}$

This problem is very similar to the problem of picking a ball at random from an urn containing balls of different color. A ball in the urn is analogous to a child, and its color is analogous to a label on the child counting the number of children in the family.

There are $4\times1+8\times2+5\times3+3\times4=47$ children (balls) in total Since a child is picked at random, *equally-likely outcomes* is a safe assumption. 

In order to compute the probability that the child (ball) comes from a family with $1$ child, we note that there are $4\times1=4$ children that have the label (color) $1$ on them. Therefore, the probability is $\frac{4}{47}$.

In order to compute the probability that the child (ball) comes from a family with $2$ child, we note that there are $8\times2=16$ children that have the label (color) $1$ on them. Therefore, the probability is $\frac{16}{47}$.

In order to compute the probability that the child (ball) comes from a family with $3$ child, we note that there are $5\times3=15$ children that have the label (color) $1$ on them. Therefore, the probability is $\frac{15}{47}$.

In order to compute the probability that the child (ball) comes from a family with $4$ child, we note that there are $3\times4=12$ children that have the label (color) $1$ on them. Therefore, the probability is $\frac{12}{47}$.
