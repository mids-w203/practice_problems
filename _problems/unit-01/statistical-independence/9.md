    Three independent events have probabilities $1/4,1/3$, and $1/2$. What is
    the probability that exactly one will occur?
answer: $\frac{11}{24}$

Let us denote the events by $A,B$, and $C$, respectively. Then $P(A)=\frac{1}{4}$, $P(B)=\frac{1}{3}$, and $P(C)=\frac{1}{2}$. 

The probability that exactly one will occur is
\\[
\begin{align}
&P((A\cap B'\cap C')\cup(A'\cap B\cap C')\cup(A'\cap B'\cap C))\\\\\
&=P(A\cap B'\cap C')+P(A'\cap B\cap C')+P(A'\cap B'\cap C),\mbox{ using inclusion-exclusion since the sets are disjoint}\\\\\
&=P(A)P(B')P(C')+P(A')P(B)P(C')+P(A')P(B')P(C)\mbox{ using independence}\\\\\
&=\frac{1}{4}\frac{2}{3}\frac{1}{2}+\frac{3}{4}\frac{1}{3}\frac{1}{2}+\frac{3}{4}\frac{2}{3}\frac{1}{2}\\\\\
&=\frac{2+3+6}{24}\\\\\
&=\frac{11}{24}.
\end{align}
