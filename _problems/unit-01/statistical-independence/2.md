    A family has $3$ children, each of whom prefers volleyball or soccer with probability $1/2$. Let $A$=&ldquo;there is at most $1$ child that prefers volleyball&rdquo; and $B$=&ldquo;the family has at least one child that prefers volleyball and at least one that prefers soccer.&rdquo;  
    (a) are $A $ and $B$ independent?  
    (b) are the events independent if the family has $4$ children?
answer: YES, NO

(a) Letting $V$ represent volleyball and $S$ represent soccer, the sample space can be written,

$\Omega=\\{(x,y,z)\| x,y,z\text{ are either }V\text{ or
}S\\}$, and $\|\Omega\|=2\times2\times2=8$. We assume *equally-likely* outcomes and *order matters*.  Then each element of $\Omega$ has probability $1/8$.

$P(A)=P(\\{(S,S,S),(V,S,S),(S,V,S),(S,S,V)\\})=\frac{4}{8}$.

$P(B)=1-P(B')=1-P(\\{(S,S,S),(V,V,V)\\})=1-\frac{2}{8}=\frac{6}{8}$.

$P(A\cap B)=P(\\{(V,S,S),(S,V,S),(S,S,V)\\})=\frac{3}{8}$.

Since $P(A\cap B)=P(A)P(B)$, they are independent.

(b)
In this case, $\|\Omega\|=2\times2\times2\times2=16$.

$P(A)$=$P(\\{(S,S,S,S),(V,S,S,S),(S,V,S,S),(S,S,V,S),(S,S,S,V)\\})$=$\frac{5}{16}.$

$P(B)=1-P(B')$=$1-P(\\{(S,S,S,S),(V,V,V,V)\\})$=$1-\frac{2}{16}=\frac{14}{16}$.

$P(A\cap B)$=$P(\\{(V,S,S,S),(S,V,S,S),(S,S,V,S),(S,S,S,V)\\})$=$\frac{4}{16}$.

Since $P(A\cap B) = \frac{4}{16} \neq \frac{35}{128}=$\frac{5}{16}\frac{14}{16} = P(A)P(B)$, $A$ and $B$ are not independent.
