statement: |
    A system has $n$ independent units, each of which fails with probability $p$. The system fails only if $k$ or more of the units fail. What is the probability that the system fails?

The probability that the system fails is equal to the probability that $k$ or more of the units fail. Alternatively, this is the complement of the probability that $k$ or more units do *not* fail. By countable additivity, the probability that $k$ or more units do not fail includes the probability that only 1 unit fails (if $k > 1$), only 2 units fail (if $k > 2$), etc., up through only $k-1$ units fail. (Countable additivity is applicable here because these sets are now pairwise distinct: if exactly 1 unit fails, by definition, 2 units did not fail, and 3 units did not fail, etc.)

The probability that 1 specific unit fails is equal to $p (1-p)^{n-1}$, since exactly 1 unit failing means that $n-1$ units did not fail. The probability of a unit not failing is the complement of the probability of the unit failing. Since we do not care if a *specific* unit fails, only that exactly 1 unit failed, there are also $n \choose 1$ units that could be the 1 unit that fails.

Extending this to additional cases, the probability that exactly $i$ units fail $= {n \choose i} p^i (1-p)^{n-i}$. Thus, if we add all of these up through exactly $k-1$ units failing, the probability that $k$ or more units do not fail is equal to $\sum_{i=1}^{k-1} {n \choose i} p^{i} (1-p)^{n-i}$.

Since this is the complement of the probability that the system fails, the probability that the system fails is $1 - \sum_{i=1}^{k-1} {n \choose i} p^{i} (1-p)^{n-i}$.
