    Three couples that were invited to dinner will independently show up with
    probabilities $0.9$, $0.89$, and $0.75$. Let $N$ be the number of couples
    that show up. Calculate the probability $P(N)$ with $N=3, 2, 1, 0$.

Let us denote the events that the couples show up by $A,B$ and $C$,
respectively. Given that $A,B,C$ are independent. We have already shown in
[Problem 21](#prob-21) that $A',B',C'$ are also independent.

\\[
\begin{align}
P(0)&=P(A'\cap B'\cap C')\\\\\
&=P(A')P(B')P(C'),\text{ since independent}\\\\\
&=(1-0.9)(1-0.89)(1-0.75),\text{ complement rule}\\\\\
&=0.1\times0.11\times0.25\\\\\
&=0.00275.
\end{align}
\\]

\\[
\begin{align}
P(3)&=P(A\cap B\cap C)\\\\\
&=P(A)P(B)P(C),\text{ since independent}\\\\\
&=0.9\times0.89\times0.75\\\\\
&=0.60075.
\end{align}
\\]

\\[
\begin{align}
P(2)&=P((A\cap B\cap C')\cup(A\cap B'\cap C)\cup(A'\cap B\cap C))\\\\\
&=P(A\cap B\cap C')+P(A\cap B'\cap C)+P(A'\cap B\cap C)),\text{ addition rule and pairwise disjoint}\\\\\
&=P(A)P(B)P(C')+P(A)P(B')P(C)+P(A')P(B)P(C)),\text{ since independent}\\\\\
&=0.9\times0.89\times(1-0.75)+0.9\times(1-0.89)\times0.75+(1-0.9)\times0.89\times0.75\\\\\
&=0.20025+0.0743+0.06675\\\\\
&=0.3413
\end{align}
\\]

Similarly, we can compute $P(1)$, or use the complement rule as follows:
$P(1)=1-[P(0)+P(2)+P(3)]=1-[0.00275+0.60075+0.3413]=1-0.9448=0.0552$.
