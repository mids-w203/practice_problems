Since we are interested only in the number of $6$'s when rolling the die, we can treat each roll as tossing a coin with HEADS being $6$ and TAILS being any other number. We assume that the die is fair, so it tranlates to $P(H)=\frac{1}{6}$ and $P(T)=\frac{5}{6}$. In the new cotext, the event $A=$ at least one H out of six tosses, and the event $B=$ at least two H's in 12 tosses. We now compute $P(A)$ and $P(B)$.

Since the coin is not fair, we can **not** assume that the outcomes are *equally-likely*.
We toss the coin multiple times. Let $H_i$ (and $T_i$) denote the events of getting H (and T) in the $i$-th trial. The problem does not say anything about independence, but it refers to it nonetheless. We assume that the coins are tossed *independently*, i.e., the events $H_i,H_j$ (and $T_i,T_j$) are statistically independent for $i\neq j$. Now,

**A:**
We toss $6$ times.
\\[
\begin{align}
P(A)&=1-P(A')\\\\\
&=1-P(T_1\cap T_2\cap\ldots\cap T_6)\\\\\
&=1-P(T_1)P(T_2)\ldots P(T_6),\text{ using independence}\\\\\
&=1-\left(\frac{5}{6}\right)^6\\\\\
&=0.6651
\end{align}
\\]

**B:**
We toss $12$ times.
\\[
P(\text{no H})=\left(\frac{5}{6}\right)^{12}=0.1121\\\\\
\\]

\\[
\begin{align}
&P(\text{exactly one H})\\\\\
&=P((H_1\cap T_2\cap\ldots\cap T_{12})\cup(T_1\cap H_2\cap\ldots\cap T_{12})\cup\ldots\cup(T_1\cap T_2\cap\ldots\cap H_{12}))\\\\\
&=P(H_1\cap T_2\cap\ldots\cap T_{12})+P(T_1\cap H_2\cap\ldots\cap T_{12})+\ldots+P(T_1\cap T_2\cap\ldots\cap H_{12}),\text{ addition rule}\\\\\
&=P(H_1)P(T_2)\ldots P(T_{12})+P(T_1)P(H_2)\ldots P(T_{12})+\ldots+P(T_1)P(T_2)\ldots P(H_{12}),\text{ using independence}\\\\\
&=12\times\frac{1}{6}\times\left(\frac{5}{6}\right)^{11}\\\\\
&=0.2692
\end{align}
\\]

So, $P(B)=1-[P(\text{ no H})+P(\text{exactly one H})]=1-(0.1121+0.2692)=0.6187$.

Therefore, $A$ is more likely than $B$.
