    Suppose we draw $2$ cards out of a deck of $52$. Let $A$=&ldquo;the first  card is an ace&rdquo; and $B$=&ldquo;the second card is a spade&rdquo;. Are $A$ and $B$ independent?
answer: YES
---
In order to check whether $A$ and $B$ are independent, we use the definition
of independence: $A,B$ are independent if $P(A\cap B)=P(A)P(B)$. Let's compute
the individual probabilities first. 

**Note:** We assume for this problem that ***order matters***. It's an
obligatory choice for this problem, since the events $A,B$ are defined by
certain positions of the cards. If we do not respect the ordering, the events
would become meaningless. From the nature of the experiment, it's also safe
to assume that the outcomes are ***equally-likely***.

The sample space \\[\Omega=\\{(c_1,c_2)\| c_1 \text{ is any card}, c_2\text{ is 
any card except for }c_1\\}.\\] So, $\|\Omega\|=52\times51$.

Since there are only $4$ aces in a standard deck, there are only
$4$ ways to get an ace for the first card. Now, the second card can be
anything---except for the ace we have already picked for the first position. So, 
the total possible ways the event $A$ can occur is $\|A\|=4\times51$. Therefore,
\\[
P(A)=\frac{\|A\|}{\|\Omega\|}=\frac{4\times51}{52\times51}.
\\]

For $B$, a similar reasoning yields
\\[
P(B)=\frac{\|B\|}{\|\Omega\|}=\frac{51\times13}{52\times51}.
\\]

The event $A\cap B$ says the first card is an ace and second card is a spade.
The computation of $P(A\cap B)$ is not very straight-forward. Let us denote by
$C$ the event that the first card is a spade. Using the *law of total
probability*, we can write
\\[
    \begin{align}
    P(A\cap B)&=P(A\cap B\cap C)+P(A\cap B\cap C')\\\\\
    &=P(\text{first card is the ace of spade and second card is a spade})\\\\\
    &+P(\text{first card is not a spade but an ace}\\\\\ 
    &\text{ and second card is a spade})\\\\\
    &=\frac{1\times12}{52\times51}+\frac{3\times13}{52\times51}\\\\\
    &=\\\\\
    &=\frac{51}{52\times51}.
    \end{align}
\\]

Since, $P(A\cap B)=P(A)P(B)$, the events are independent.
