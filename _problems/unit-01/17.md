    A family has $3$ children, each of whom is a boy or a girl with probability
    $1/2$. Let $A$=&ldquo;there is at most $1$ girl&rdquo; and $B$=&ldquo;the family has children of both sexes.&rdquo;

    (a) Are $A$ and $B$ independent?
    
    (b) Are $A$ and $B$ independent if the family has $4$ children?

(a)
The sample space is $\Omega=\\{(x,y,z)\|x,y,z\text{ are a Girl or Boy}\\}$.

$P(A)=P(\\{(B,B,B),(G,B,B),(B,G,B),(B,B,G)\\})=\frac{4}{8}$.

$P(B)=1-P(B')=1-P(\\{(B,B,B),(G,G,G)\\})=1-\frac{2}{8}=\frac{5}{8}$.

$P(A\cap B)=P(\\{(G,B,B),(B,G,B),(B,B,G)\\})=\frac{3}{8}$.

Not independent.

(b)
The sample space is $\Omega=\\{(x,y,z,w)\|x,y,z,w\text{ are a Girl or Boy}\\}$.

$P(A)=P(\\{(B,B,B,B),(G,B,B,B),(B,G,B,B),(B,B,G,B),(B,B,B,G)\\})=\frac{4}{16}$.

$P(B)=1-P(B')=1-P(\\{(B,B,B,B),(G,G,G,G)\\})=1-\frac{2}{16}$.

$P(A\cap B)=P(\\{(G,B,B,B),(B,G,B,B),(B,B,G,B),(B,B,B,G)\\})=\frac{4}{16}$.

Not independent.
