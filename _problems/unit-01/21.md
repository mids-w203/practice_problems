    Two students, Alice and Betty, are registered for a statistics class. Alice
    attends $80\%$ of the time, Betty $60\%$ of the time, and their absences are
    independent. On a given day, what is the probability that 
    
    (a) at least one of these students is in class
    
    (b) exactly one of them is there?

Let $A$ denote the event that Alice is present, and let $B$ denote the event that Betty is present in class. We are given $P(A)=0.8$ and $P(B)=0.6$. Also, we know that $A'$ and $B'$ are independent.

(a) We first derive a little fact: if $A'$ and $B'$ are independent, so are $A$ and $B$.
\\[
\begin{align}
P(A\cap B)&=1-P((A\cap B)'),\text{ complement rule}\\\\\
&=1-P(A'\cup B'),\text{ De Morgan's law}\\\\\
&=1-[P(A')+P(B')-P(A'\cap B')],\text{ addition rule}\\\\\
&=1-[P(A')+P(B')-P(A')P(B')],\text{ using independence}\\\\\
&=1-P(A')-P(B')+P(A')P(B')\\\\\
&=(1-P(A'))(1-P(B'))\\\\\
&=P(A)P(B),\text{ complement rule}
\end{align}
\\]
Hence, $A$ and $B$ are indepedent.

\\[
    \begin{align}
    &P(\text{at least one of them is present})\\\\\
    &=P(A\cup B)\\\\\
    &=P(A)+P(B)-P(A\cap B),\text{ addition rule}\\\\\
    &=P(A)+P(B)-P(A)P(B),\text{ using independence}\\\\\
    &=0.8+0.6-0.8\times0.6\\\\\
    &=1.4-0.48\\\\\
    &=0.92.
    \end{align}
\\]

(b) 
We also show the following fact: if $A$ and $B$ are independent, so are $A$ and $B'$. We note first that $A$ is the union of the disjoint sets $(A\cap B')$ and $(A\cap B)$. By the addition rule, we then get
\\[
\begin{align}
&P(A)=P(A\cap B')+P(A\cap B)\\\\\
\implies &P(A)=P(A\cup B')+P(A)P(B),\text{ since independent}\\\\\
\implies &P(A\cap B')=P(A)-P(A)P(B)\\\\\
\implies &P(A\cap B')=P(A)(1-P(B))\\\\\
\implies &P(A\cap B')=P(A)P(B'),\text{ complement rule}
\end{align}
\\]
Hence, $A$ and $B'$ are indepedent. A similar argument will also show that $A'$ and $B$ are independent.

Let us denote by $E$ the event that exactly one of them is present. Then, $E$
can be expressed as the union of the disjoint sets $(A\cap B')$ and $(B\cap A')$. Again, by 
the addition rule,
\\[
\begin{align}
P(E)&=P(A\cap B')+P(A'\cap B)\\\\\
&=P(A)P(B)+P(A')P(B)\\\\\
&=0.8\times(1-0.6)+(1-0.8)\times0.6\\\\\
&=0.8\times0.4+0.2\times0.6\\\\\
&=0.32+0.12\\\\\
&=0.44
\end{align}
\\]
