    Two students, Alice and Betty, are registered for a statistics class. Alice
    attends $80\%$ of the time, Betty $60\%$ of the time, and their absences are
    independent. On a given day, what is the probability that 
    
    (a) at least one of these students is in class
    
    (b) exactly one of them is there?

Let $A$ denote the event that Alice is present, and let $B$ denote the event that Betty is present in class. We are given $P(A)=0.8$ and $P(B)=0.6$. Also, we know that $A'$ and $B'$ are independent.

(a) We first derive a little fact: if $A'$ and $B'$ are independent, so are $A$ and $B$.
\\[
\begin{align}
P(A\cap B)&=1-P((A\cap B)'),\text{ complement rule}\\\\\
&=1-P(A'\cup B'),\text{ De Morgan's law}\\\\\
&=1-[P(A')+P(B')-P(A'\cap B')],\text{ addition rule}\\\\\
&=1-[P(A')+P(B')-P(A')P(B')],\text{ using independence}\\\\\
&=1-P(A')-P(B')+P(A')P(B')\\\\\
&=(1-P(A'))(1-P(B'))\\\\\
&=P(A)P(B),\text{ complement rule}
\end{align}
\\]
Hence, $A$ and $B$ are indepedent.

\\[
    \begin{align}
    &P(\text{at least one of them is present})\\\\\
    &=P(A\cup B)\\\\\
    &=P(A)+P(B)-P(A\cap B),\text{ addition rule}\\\\\
    &=P(A)+P(B)-P(A)P(B),\text{ using independence}\\\\\
    &=0.8+0.6-0.8\times0.6\\\\\
    &=1.4-0.48\\\\\
    &=0.92.
    \end{align}
\\]

(b) Let us denote by $E$ the event that exactly one of them is present. Then,
$E$ can be expressed as $(A\cap B')\cup(B\cap A')$. 

We also note that $A\cup B$ can be written as the union of the following pairwise
disjoint sets: $E$ and $A\cap B$.

Since they are disjoint, by addition rule, we get
\\[
\begin{align}
&P(A\cup B)=P(E)+P(A\cap B)\\\\\
\implies &P(A)+P(B)-P(A\cap B)=P(E)+P(A\cap B),\text{ addition rule}\\\\\
\implies &P(E)=P(A)+P(B)-2P(A\cap B),\text{ isolation}\\\\\\
\implies &P(E)=P(A)+P(B)-2P(A)P(B),\text{ using independence}\\\\\\
\implies &P(E)=0.8+0.6-2\times0.8\times0.6\\\\\
\implies &P(E)=1.4-0.96=0.44.
\end{align}
\\]
