    $15\%$ do both. What fraction of students have at least one of these bad
    habits?
number: 12
answer:  $70\%$

Let $C$ and $A$ denote the probability that a randomly picked student in the
group smoke cigarettes and drink alcohol, respectively. From the information give, we deduce that $P(C)=0.25$, $P(A)=0.6$, and $P(C\cap A)=0.15$.

The event that a student has at least on of these bad habits is $C\cup A$. And,
\\[
    \begin{align}
    P(C\cup A)&=P(C)+P(A)-P(C\cap A)\text{ Additive rule }\\\\\
    &=0.25+0.6-0.15\\\\\
    &=0.7.
    \end{align}    
\\]
Therefore, 70% of students have at one of these bad habits.
