    Roll two dice. Let $A$=&ldquo;the first die is odd,&rdquo; $B$=&ldquo;the second die is odd,&rdquo; and $C$=&ldquo;the sum is odd.&rdquo; Show that these events are pairwise independent but not independent.

From the table in [Problem 3](#prob-3), we get $P(A)=\frac{1}{2}$,
$P(B)=\frac{1}{2}$, and $P(C)=\frac{1}{2}$.

Also, $P(A\cap B)=P(\text{both are odd})=\frac{9}{36}=\frac{1}{4}$. We note that
$P(A\cap C)=P(B\cap C)=\frac{1}{4}$. Therefore, we conclude that the events $A,B,C$ are pairwise independent.

However, $P(A\cap B\cap C)$=$P(\text{both are odd, but the sum is
odd})$=$P(\emptyset)=0$.

Since $P(A\cap B\cap C)\neq P(A)P(B)P(C)$, the events are not independent.
