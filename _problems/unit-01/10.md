Let $\Omega$ denote the set of all $320$ high school students. Let $C$ and $M$
denote the set of students that went to college and the set of male students,
respectively. We have $\|\Omega\|=320$, $\|C\|=160$, $\|M\|=170$, and $\|C\cap
M\|=100$.

We note that $M'\cap C'$ denotes the set of women that did not go to college.
Now,
\\[
    \begin{align}
    \|M'\cap C'\|&=\|(M\cup C)'\|\\\\\
    &=\|\Omega\|-\|(M\cup C)\|\\\\\
    &=\|\Omega\|-(\|M\|+\|C\|-\|M\cap C\|)\\\\\
    &=320-(170+160-100)\\\\\
    &=320-230\\\\\
    &=90.
    \end{align}
\\]
Threfore, $90$ women did not go to college.
