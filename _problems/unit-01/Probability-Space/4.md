    If we flip a coin 5 times, what is the probability that the number of heads
    is an even number (that is, divisible by 2)?
---
In the random experiment of tossing a coin $5$ times, an example outcome is
$HTTHT$. Assuming that order matters, the total number of outputs,
$|\Omega|=2.2.2.2.2=2^5=32$.

<br><br>
Let us denote by $E$ the event that the number of heads is an even number.
Therefore, it's complement, $E'$ denotes the event that number of heads is an
odd number. Note that our example output $HTTHT\in E$. We also note that
$E$ and $E'$ partitions the sample space $\Omega$. 

<br>
We claim that $E$ and $E'$ contain equal number of outcomes from $\Omega$.
