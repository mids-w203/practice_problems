number: 2
statement: |
    Suppose we pick a number at random from the phone book and look at the last
    digit.
    <br>
    (a) What is the set of outcomes and what probability should be assigned
    to each outcome?
    <br>
    (b) Would this model be appropriate if we were looking at the
    first digit?
---
(a) The set of outcomes, $\Omega=\{0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9\}$.
<br>
If the number is picked at random, we may assume that the outcomes are
equally-likely. Therefore, each outcome will have an equal probability of
$1/10$.

(b) <b>No</b>. In this case, $0$ is not an outcome.
