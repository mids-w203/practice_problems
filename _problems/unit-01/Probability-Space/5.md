statement: |
    Two boys are repeatedly playing a game that they each have probability $1/2$ of winning. The first person to win $5$ games wins the match. What is the probability that Al will win if 
    (a) he has won $4$ games and Bobby has won $3$ and
    (b) he leads by a score of $3$ games to $2$?
number: 8
---
(a) Since Al has already won $4$ games and Bobby has won $3$, seven games have
already been played. In order for Al to win the match, he has to *either* win
the eighth game *or* lose the eighth but wins the ninth.

Let $A$ denote the event that Al wins the eighth game, and $B$ denote the event
that Bobby wins the eighth game but loses the ninth game. 

\\[
    \begin{align}
    P(\text{Al wins}) &=P(A\cup B)\\\\\
    &=P(A)+P(B)-P(A\cap B)\text{, (Additive Law)}\\\\\
    &=
    \end{align}
