statement: |
    In Galileoâ€™s time people thought that when three dice were rolled, a sum of
    $9$ and a sum of $10$ had the same probability since each could be obtained
    in $6$ ways: 
    $$9: 1 + 2 + 6, 1 + 3 + 5, 1 + 4 + 4, 2 + 2 + 5, 2 + 3 + 4, 3 + 3 + 3$$
    $$10 : 1 + 3 + 6, 1 + 4 + 5, 2 + 4 + 4, 2 + 3 + 5, 2 + 4 + 4, 3 + 3 + 4$$
    
    Compute the probabilities of these sums and show that 10 is a more likely
    total than 9.
