    In Galileoâ€™s time people thought that when three dice were rolled, a sum of $9$ and a sum of $10$ had the same probability since each could be obtained in $6$ ways: 
    \\[9: [1, 2, 6], [1, 3, 5], [1, 4, 4], [2, 2, 5], [2, 3, 4], [3, 3, 3]\\]
    \\[10 : [1,3, 6], [1, 4, 5], [2, 4, 4], [2, 3, 5], [2, 2, 6], [3, 3, 4]\\]
    
    Compute the probabilities of these sums and show that 10 is a more likely total than 9.

In Galileo's time, people might have neglected the effect of the order the
outcomes were observed. In fact, the veracity of their result can be explained
by assuming that ***order does not matter***. 

In our time, however, we assume for this problem that ***order matters***. For
instance, unlike the old days, we are assuming that the outcome $(1,2,6)$ is
different from the outcome $(2,1,6)$. So, all $3!=6$ permutations, now distinct,
will also sum up to $9$. Similarly, for each combination from Galileo's time, we
now account for all of its distinct permutations. We summarize it in the
following tables:

| Combination for $9$ | Number of permutations |
| --------------------| ---------------------- |
| $(1,2,6)$           | $6$                    |
| $(1,3,5)$           | $6$                    |
| $(1,4,4)$           | $3$                    |
| $(2,2,5)$           | $3$                    |
| $(2,3,4)$           | $6$                    |
| $(3,3,3)$           | $1$                    |
| Total               | $25$                   |



| Combination for $10$| Number of permutations |
| --------------------| ---------------------- |
| $(1,3,6)$           | $6$                    |
| $(1,4,5)$           | $6$                    |
| $(2,4,4)$           | $3$                    |
| $(2,3,5)$           | $6$                    |
| $(2,2,6)$           | $3$                    |
| $(3,3,4)$           | $3$                    |
| Total               | $27$                   |


We have already seen that the size of the sample space is such an experiment is
$\Omega=6\times6\times6=216$. If we assume that the outcomes are
*equally-likely*, then
\\[P(9)=\frac{25}{216}\text{ and }P(10)=\frac{27}{216}.\\]
Therefore, $10$ is a more likely total than $9$.
