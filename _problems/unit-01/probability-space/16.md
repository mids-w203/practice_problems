Suppose that there are $n$ people in a room. For each person, every day of the year is equally likely to be their birthday. Moreover, the birthdays of each person are mutually independent. What is the probability that at least two in room containing $n$ people have a common birthday?
answer:  $1 - {}^{365}P_n/365^n$

Hint: Can you compute the probability that no two persons in the room have a common birthday? Then, use the complement rule.
