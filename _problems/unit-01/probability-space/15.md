    Given two events $A$ and $B$ with $P(A)=0.4$ and $P(B)=0.7$, what are the maximum and minimum possible values for $P(A\cap B)$?
answer: $0.4,0.1$

A simple bound for probability comes from the Kolmogorov's Axioms. For *any*
event $E$ in *any* probability space, $0\leq P(E)\leq1$. The question is can we
give a better (tighter) bounds for the event $(A\cap B)$ in light of the extra
information provided for $A$ and $B$.

**Maximum:** We note that $A\cap B\subseteq A$ and $A\cap B\subseteq B$. From
*monotonicity*, it follows that 
\\[
    \begin{align}
    P(A\cap B)&\leq\min\\{P(A),P(B)\\}\\\\\
    &\leq\min\\{0.4,0.7\\}\\\\\
    &=0.4.
    \end{align}
\\]
So, the maximum possible value for $P(A\cap B)$ is $0.4$.

**Minimum:** From the *additive rule*, we have
\\[
    \begin{align}
    P(A\cap B)&=P(A)+P(B)-P(A\cup B)\\\\\
    &\geq P(A)+P(B)-1,\text{ since }P(A\cup B)\leq 1\\\\\
    &=0.4+0.7-1\\\\\
    &=0.1.
    \end{align}
\\]
So, the minimum possible value for $P(A\cap B)$ is $0.1$.
