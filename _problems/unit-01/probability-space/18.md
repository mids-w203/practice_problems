    A lot of $n$ items contains $k$ defectives, and $m$ are selected randomly and inspected. How should the value of $m$ be chosen so that the probability that at least one defective item turns up is $0.9$? 

    Apply your answer to  
    (a) $n=1000, k=10$
    (b) $n=10,000, k=100$.

Let us denote by $A$ the event that at least one defective item turns up. As is sometimes the case, computing $P(A^c)$ is easier than computing $P(A)$ directly. 

We note that $A^c$ denotes the event that no defective item turns up. During each draw from the collection, each item has an equal chance to be picked. So, 
\\[
	P(A^c)=\frac{\|A^c\|}{\|\Omega\|},
\\]
where $\Omega$ is the sample space---all possible ways $m$ items are selected. We also make the following assumptions:  
1. since we are interested in the count of the defective items, we assume that order does not matter.   
2. items are picked without replacement.  

So, $\|\Omega\|={n \choose m}$. In order to compute $\|A^c\|$ or the number of ways $m$ items are chosen from the non-defectives. There are $n-k$ such items, hence $\|A\|={n-k\choose m}$. Consequently,
\\[
\begin{align}
P(A^c) &=\frac{n-k\choose m}{n\choose m} \\\\\\
&=\frac{\frac{(n-k)!}{(n-k-m)!m!}}{\frac{n!}{(n-m)!m!}} \\\\\\
&=\frac{(n-k)!(n-m)!}{(n-k-m)!n!}.
\end{align}
\\]

Therefore, we can choose the value of $m$ such that $P(A^c)=1-P(A)=1-0.9=0.1$.
