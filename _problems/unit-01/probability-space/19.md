    A monkey at a typewriter types each of the $26$ letters of the alphabet exactly once, the order being random.

    (a) What is the probability that the word *Hamlet* appears somewhere in the string of letters?  
    (b) How many independent monkey typists would you need in order that the probability that the word appears is at least $0.9$?
