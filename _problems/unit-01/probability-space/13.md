    As of right now, this question has a mistake in it â€“ it repeats question 12. Just igonore this question until we resolve it. There are lots more that you could work on! $24\%$ of people have American Express cards, $61\%$ have Visa cards, and $8\%$ have both. What percentage of people have at least one of the two cards?
answer: $0.4,0.3,0.3$

    \begin{align}
    P(\\{a\\})&=1-P(\\{a\\}'),\text{ complement rule }\\\\\
    &=1-P(\\{b,c\\})\\\\\
    &=1-0.6\\\\\
    &=0.4
    \end{align}    
\\]
Similarly, $P(\\{c\\})=0.3$.

\\[
    \begin{align}
    P(\\{b\\})&=P(\\{a,b\\}\cap\\{b,c\\})\\\\\
    &=P(\\{a,b\\})+P(\\{b,c\\})-P(\\{a,b\\}\cup\\{b,c\\}),\text{ complement rule }\\\\\
    &=P(\\{a,b\\})+P(\\{b,c\\})-P(\\{a,b,c\\})\\\\\
    &=0.7+0.6-1\\\\\
    &=0.3
    \end{align}    
\\]
