    Two children, Zoe and Kamal, are repeatedly playing a game that they each have probability $1/2$ of winning. The first person to win $5$ games wins the match. What is the probability that Zoe will win if   
    (a) She has won $4$ games and Kamal has won $3$ and  
    (b) She leads by a score of $3$ games to $2$?
answer: (a) 0.75,   (b) $\frac{11}{16}$

(a) The set of possible outcomes where $Z$ wins is $\\{Z, KZ\\}$, so the probability is $$P(Z) + P(K)P(K) = 1/2 + (1/2)(1/2) = 0.75.$$

(b) The set in this case is $\\{ZZ, ZKZ, ZKKZ, KZZ, KZKZ, KKZZ\\}$. Note that order matters. Plugging in and adding probabilities same as in (a), you get $11/16$.
