    Suppose we roll three dice. Compute the probability that the sum is (a) $3$, (b) $4$, (c) $5$, (d) $6$, (e) $7$, (f) $8$, (g) $9$, (h) $10$.
answer:  $70\%$

Let $C$ denote the event that a randomly picked student in the group smokes cigarettes, and let $A$ be the event that the student drinks alcohol. From the information given, we see that $P(C)=0.25$, $P(A)=0.6$, and $P(C\cap A)=0.15$.

The event that a student has at least one of these bad habits is $C\cup A$. And,
\\[
    \begin{align}
    P(C\cup A)&=P(C)+P(A)-P(C\cap A)\text{, addition rule }\\\\\
    &=0.25+0.6-0.15\\\\\
    &=0.7.
    \end{align}    
\\]
Therefore, 70% of students have at one of these bad habits.
