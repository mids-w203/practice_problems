    Roll two dice. Let $A$=&ldquo;the sum is even&rdquo; and $B$=&ldquo;the sum is divisible by $3$,&rdquo; that is, $B=\\{3, 6, 9, 12\\}$. Are $A$ and $B$ independent?
answer: 'YES'

Referring to the table in [Problem 3](#prob-3), we enumerating all the outcomes of the event $A$ to find $P(A)=\frac{1}{2}$.

We also note the following combinations to make an sum divisible by 3:

$3$|$(1,2),(2,1)$
$6$|$(1,5),(2,4),(3,3),(4,2),(5,1)$
$9$|$(3,6),(4,5),(5,4),(6,3)$
$12$|$(6,6)$

So, $P(B)=\frac{2+5+4+1}{36}=\frac{12}{36}=\frac{1}{3}$.

For $A\cap B$, we enumerate from the table the outcomes that sum up to only
$6$ and $12$. So, $P(A\cap B)=\frac{5+1}{36}=\frac{6}{36}=\frac{1}{6}$.

Since $P(A\cap B)=P(A)P(B)$, the events are independent.
