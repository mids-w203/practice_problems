    Roll two dice. Let $A$=&ldquo;the sum is even&rdquo; and $B$=&ldquo;the sum is divisible by $3$,&rdquo; that is, $B=\\{3, 6, 9, 12\\}$. Are $A$ and $B$ independent?

On a moment's reflection, half the outcomes of $\Omega$ sum up to a even number and the other half to a odd number. You may also convince yourself by enumerating all the outcomes, as we did in [Problem 3](#prob-3). So, $P(A)=\frac{1}{2}$.

$3$: $(1,2),(2,1)$

$6$: $(1,5),(2,4),(3,3),(4,2),(5,1)$

$9$: $(3,6),(4,5),(5,4),(6,3)$

$12$: $(6,6)$

$P(B)=\frac{12}{36}=\frac{1}{3}$.

$P(A\cap B)=\frac{6}{36}=\frac{1}{6}$.

Not independent.
