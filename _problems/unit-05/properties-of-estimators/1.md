statement: |
    Suppose that $$X_1, X_2, ...$$ is a sequence of iid random variables, each distributed uniform over $$[0,a]$$, where $$a>0$$ is an unknown parameter.  Define $$M_n = \frac{2}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n X_i$$. 

    a. Prove that each $$M_n$$ is an unbiased estimator for $$a$$.

    b. Prove that $$\{M_n\}$$ is a consistent estimator for $$a$$.
