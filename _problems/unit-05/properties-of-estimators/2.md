    Suppose that $\\{X_1, X_2, ...\\}$ is a sequence of independent Bernoulli random variables, with common parameter $p$.  For each $n \in \\{1,2,...\\}$, define the estimator $M_n = X_1$. 

    a. Prove that each $M_n$ is an unbiased estimator for $p$.

    b. Prove that $\\{M_n\\}$ is not a consistent estimator for $p$.
