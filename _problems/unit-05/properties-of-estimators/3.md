caption: Get Paid Back for Shoddy Chips
statement: |
    Suppose that you buy $$n$$ silicon chips, numbered $$1,2,..,n$$.  Let random variable $$L_i$$ represent the lifespan of chip $$i$$. Assume all $$L_i$$ are i.i.d. with common expectation 2. The manufacturer agrees to refund you an amount (in dollars) equal to $$(4 - \sum_{i=1}^n L_i/n)^2 $$.

    Prove that as $n \to \infty$, the probability limit of your refund is 4 dollars.
