statement: |
    A coin is thrown independently $10$ times to test the hypothesis that the probability of heads is $\frac{1}{2}$ versus the alternative that the probability is not $\frac{1}{2}$ . The test rejects if either $0$ or $ 10$ heads are observed.

    (a) What is the significance level of the test?  
    (b) If, in fact, the probability of heads is $0.1$, what is the power of the test?
answer: $0.002, 0.349$
