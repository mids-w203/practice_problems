    This is a question that comes from *An Introduction to Statistical Learning*. 

   Consider the fitted values taht results from performing linear regression without an intercept. That is, you fit the following model: 

   $$
   Y = 0 + \beta_{1}X + \epsilon
   $$

   You could move this into a summation form, using our definitions of the regression estimators, which would look like the following: 

   $$ 
   \hat{\beta} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_{i}y_{i}}{\sum_{i'=1}^{n} x_{i'}^{2}}
   $$

   (In this notation, we're just using $i$ and $i'$ to distinguish the two summations, but they are both summing over the same data points.) 

   Show that we can write the fitted values from this regression as: 

   $$
   \hat{y}_{i} = \sum_{i'=1}^{n} a_{i'}y_{i'}
   $$

   In this format, what is $a_{i'}$?

   What you should note is that fitted values from a linear regression are linear combinations of the response variables.
