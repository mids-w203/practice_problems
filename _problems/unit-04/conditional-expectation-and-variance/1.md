    In $\mathbb{R}^2$, define square region A with corners at $\\{ (0,1), (1,1),(1,2), (0,2) \\}$ and square region B with corners at $\\{ (0.5,0),(1.5,0),(1.5,1),(0.5,1) \\}$.  Suppose that random variables X and Y have joint density given by,

    $$f(x,y) = \begin{cases} 0.5, &(x,y) \in A \cup B \\\\\
    0, &otherwise
    \end{cases} 
    $$

    1. Compute the conditional expectation function of Y given X.  
    2. Compute the conditional expectation function of X given Y.

    To compute the conditional expectation functions, we need to find the conditional probability density functions (PDFs) first. Once we have those, we can calculate the conditional expectations.

    Compute the conditional expectation function of Y given X:

The conditional PDF of Y given X is given by:

$f_{Y∣X}(y∣x)=\frac{f(x,y)}{f_X(x)}$​

where
    $f(x, y)$ is the joint PDF, which is given as 0.5 when $(x, y)$ is in either region A or region B.
    $f_X(x)$ is the marginal PDF of X, which is the integral of the joint PDF over all possible values of Y for a given X.

Let's compute $f_X(x)$ first:

For $0 \leq x \leq 0.5$ and $1 \leq x \leq 1.5$ (regions A and B), $f_X(x)$ is 0.5 since the joint PDF is constant within these regions.

For $0.5 \leq x \leq 1$ and $1.5 \leq x \leq 2$ (outside both regions), $f_X(x)$ is 0 since the joint PDF is 0 outside the squares.

Now, let's compute the conditional expectation of Y given X:

For $0 \leq x \leq 0.5$ and $1 \leq x \leq 1.5$ (regions A and B):

fY∣X(y∣x)=0.50.5=1fY∣X​(y∣x)=0.50.5​=1

For $0.5 \leq x \leq 1$ and $1.5 \leq x \leq 2$ (outside both regions):

Since the joint PDF is 0 outside the squares, $f_{Y|X}(y|x) = 0$ for these regions.

So, the conditional expectation function of Y given X is:
0, & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}$$
2. Compute the conditional expectation function of X given Y:
The conditional PDF of X given Y is given by:
$$f_{X|Y}(x|y) = \frac{f(x, y)}{f_Y(y)}$$
where
- $f(x, y)$ is the joint PDF, which is given as 0.5 when $(x, y)$ is in either region A or region B.
- $f_Y(y)$ is the marginal PDF of Y, which is the integral of the joint PDF over all possible values of X for a given Y.
Let's compute $f_Y(y)$ first:
For $1 \leq y \leq 2$ (regions A and B), $f_Y(y)$ is 0.5 since the joint PDF is constant within these regions.
For $0 \leq y \leq 1$ (outside both regions), $f_Y(y)$ is 0 since the joint PDF is 0 outside the squares.
Now, let's compute the conditional expectation of X given Y:
For $1 \leq y \leq 2$ (regions A and B):
$$f_{X|Y}(x|y) = \frac{0.5}{0.5} = 1$$
For $0 \leq y \leq 1$ (outside both regions):
Since the joint PDF is 0 outside the squares, $f_{X|Y}(x|y) = 0$ for these regions.
So, the conditional expectation function of X given Y is:
$$E(X|Y) = \begin{cases} 1, & 1 \leq y \leq 2 \\\\
0, & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}$$
These are the conditional expectation functions of Y given X and X given Y based on the given joint PDF.
