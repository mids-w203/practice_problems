    In $\mathbb{R}^2$, define square region A with corners at $\\{ (0,1), (1,1),(1,2), (0,2) \\}$ and square region B with corners at $\\{ (0.5,0),(1.5,0),(1.5,1),(0.5,1) \\}$.  Suppose that random variables X and Y have joint density given by,

    $$f(x,y) = \begin{cases} 0.5, &(x,y) \in A \cup B \\\\\
    0, &otherwise
    \end{cases} 
    $$

    1. Compute the conditional expectation function of Y given X.  
    2. Compute the conditional expectation function of X given Y.
