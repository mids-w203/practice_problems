statement: |
    Suppose X and Y have joint density given by,

    $$f(x,y) = \begin{cases} 1, &0 \leq x \leq 1, 0 \leq y \leq 1\\\\\
    0, &otherwise
    \end{cases}
    $$

    1. Prove that the linear predictor $g(x) = 0.5$ fulfills the first population moment condition.

    2. Prove that the linear predictor $g(x) = 0.5$ fulfills the second population moment condition.

    You conclude that $g$ is the BLP.
