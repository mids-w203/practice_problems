caption: BLP for a Square
statement: |
    Suppose X and Y have joint density given by,

    $$f(x,y) = \begin{cases} 1, &0 \leq x \leq 1, 0 \leq y \leq 1\\\\\
    0, &otherwise
    \end{cases}
    $$

    1. Prove that the linear predictor $g(x) = 0.5$ fulfills the first population moment condition.

    2. Prove that the linear predictor $g(x) = 0.5$ fulfills the second population moment condition.

    You conclude that $g$ is the BLP.

We write the equation for error,

$$\epsilon = Y - g(X) = Y - 0.5$$

Taking the expectation,

$$E[\epsilon] = E[Y - 0.5] = E[Y] - 0.5$$

Computing the expectation of $Y$,

$$
\begin{align}
E[Y] &= \int_{y=0}^1 \int_{x=0}^1 (1)y dxdy \\
&= \int_{y=0}^1  xy \vert_{x=0}^1 dy\\
&= \int_{y=0}^1  y dy \\
&= y^2/2 \vert_{y=0}^1 = 0.5
\end{align}
$$

Plugging into the previous equation, we get $$E[\epsilon] = 0.5 - 0.5 = 0$$, which is the first moment condition.
