caption: Closer Look at Moment Conditions
statement: |
    Suppose X and Y have joint mass function given by,

    $$f(x,y) = \begin{cases} 0.25,  &(x,y) \in \\{ (1,1),(1,-1), (-1,1), (-1,-1) \\} \\\\\
    0, &otherwise
    \end{cases}
    $$

    Consider a linear predictor, $g(x) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x$, and let $\epsilon = Y - g(X)$ be the error term.

    1. Compute $E[\epsilon]$ in terms of $\beta_0$ and $\beta_1$.

    Now set $\beta_0$ to fulfill the first moment condition: $E[\epsilon] = 0$.

    2. Compute $E[X \epsilon]$ in terms of $\beta_1$

    Now set $\beta_1$ to fulfill the second moment condition: $E[X \epsilon] = 0$.

    3. What is the BLP?
