    At the highly competitive collegiate quizbowl championship, there are with 18 Stanford dorks and 12 Berkely dweebs in the audience. Because it is quizbowl, of course the audience is also playing along with the contestents on stage. 

    The Stanford dorks, have a probability $\frac{1}{3}$ of knowing the answer. The Berkeley dweebs have a probability $\frac{1}{2}$ of knowing the answer to a typical question the host asks. 

    Then, find the following quantities: 
 
    *  The mean and variance of the number of Stanford dorks who know the answer. 
    *  The mean and variance of the number of Berkeley dweebs who know the answer. 
    *  The mean and variance of the entire audience (including both Stanford dorks and Berkeley dweebs) who know the answer. 

    Assume that whether or not the students know the answer are independent events.
