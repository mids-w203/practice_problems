    Suppose $P (X \in\\{1, 2, 3\\})=1$ and $E[X]=2.5$. What are the smallest and largest possible values for the variance?

 To find the smallest and largest possible values for the variance of $VAR(X)$, given that $X \in\\{1, 2, 3\\}$ and $E(X) = $2.5$, we need to consider how variance is affected by the distribution of probabilities among the values of $X$.

**1. Minimizing VAR(X):**

$VAR(X)$ is represented as:

$VAR(X) = E[(X - \mu)^2]]$

The variance is minimized when the values of X are closest to the mean. Since the mean is 2.5, we can achieve the minimum variance by having X take on values as close to 2.5 as possible. Let $P(X=2) = p$ and $P(X=3) = 1 - p$. The mean is given by:

\begin(align)
2p + 3(1 - p) = 2.5 \\\\
2p + 3 - 3p = 2.5 \\\\
-p = -0.5 \\\\
p = 0.5 \\\\
\end(align)

So, $P(X=2) = 0.5$ and $P(X=3) = 0.5$. The variance in this case is:

\begin(align)
VAR(X) &= 0.5(2 - 2.5)^2 + 0.5(3 - 2.5)^2 \\\\
&= 0.5(-0.5)^2 + 0.5(0.5)^2 \\\\
& = 0.5 \times 0.25 + 0.5 \times 0.25 \\\\
& = 0.125 + 0.125 \\\\
& = 0.25 
\end(align)

So, the smallest possible variance is 0.25.

**2. Maximizing VAR(X):**

The variance is maximized when the values of X are farthest from the mean. This would be achieved by having X be 1 and 3, the two values farthest from the mean. Let's say $P(X=1) = q and $P(X=3) = 1 - q. Using the mean:

\begin(align)
1q + 3(1 - q) = 2.5 \\\\
q + 3 - 3q = 2.5 \\\\
-2q = -0.5 \\\\
q = 0.25 
\end(align)

So, $P(X=1) = 0.25$ and $P(X=3) = 0.75$. The variance in this case is:

\begin(align)
VAR(X) &= 0.25(1 - 2.5)^2 + 0.75(3 - 2.5)^2 \\\\
& = 0.25(-1.5)^2 + 0.75(0.5)^2 \\\\
& = 0.25 \times 2.25 + 0.75 \times 0.25 \\\\
& = 0.5625 + 0.1875 \\\\
& = 0.75
\end(align)

So, the largest possible variance is 0.75.
