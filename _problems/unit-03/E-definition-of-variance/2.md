    Can we have a random variable with $E[X]=3$ and $E[X^2]=8$? Give an example or prove that it is impossible.

Start by writing the alternate definition of variance: 

$$
  V[X] = E[X^2] - E[X]^2
$$

Notice that we have very nearly all the pieces to write into this formula, since we possess information about $E[X]$ and $E[X^2]$. 

And so, substituting in for these values, we have 

$$
  V[X] = 8 - (3)^2 = -1
$$

However, we know that we cannot have a negative variance. Thus, the given random variable cannot exist.
