    A bet is said to carry 3 to 1 odds if you win \\$3 for each \\$1 you bet. What must the probability of winning be for this to be a fair bet?
answer: $\frac{1}{4}$
---
Let $p$ be the probability of winning the bet, also let $X$ denote the random variable that indicates the winning amount. Then, the support of $X$ is $$\{\$3,\$-1\}$$. So,

$$E[X]=3\times P(X=\$3)+(-1)\times P(X=\$-1)=3p-(1-p)=4p-1.$$

Setting $E[X]=0$, we get $c=\frac{1}{4}$, In order for the bet to be fair, the probability of winning must  be $\frac{1}{4}$.
