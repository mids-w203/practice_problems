    A lottery has one \\$100 prize, two \\$25 prizes, and five \\$10 prizes. What should you be willing to pay for a ticket if 100 tickets are sold?
answer: \$2
---
Let $X$ denote the prize amount that a random ticket holder wins.  Since $100$ tickets are sold,
$$P(X=\$100)=\frac{1}{100}$$, $$P(X=\$25)=\frac{2}{100}$$, and $$P(X=\$10)=\frac{5}{100}.$$
 
 So, $$E[X]=100\times\frac{1}{100}+25\times\frac{2}{100}+10\times\frac{5}{100}=\frac{200}{100}=\$2.$$
 
 Therefore, one should be willing to pay at most $$\$2$$ dollars.
