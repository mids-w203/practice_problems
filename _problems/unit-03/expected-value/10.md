    An unreliable clothes dryer dries your clothes and takes 20 minutes with probability 0.6 and buzzes for 4 minutes and does nothing with probability 0.4. If we assume that successive trials are independent and that we patiently keep putting our money in to try to get it to work, what is the expected time we need to get our clothes dry?
---
For each trial, the dryer either dries ($D$) or buzzes ($B$). So, an attempt ($\omega\in\Omega$) to dry our clothes can be expressed by a sequence of $B$'s with a $D$ at the end. Our sample space $\Omega$ is an infinite set: 
\\[
\\{D,BD,BBD,BBBD,BBBBD,\ldots\\}
\\]

Since the trials are independent, we compute the probability of any sequence $\omega\in\Omega$.
\\[
P(BBB\ldots\mbox{ k copies }\ldots BD)=(0.4)^k\times0.6. 
\\]

Let $T$ be the random variable that measures the total time needed to get it to work. For $k\geq0$,
\\[
t_k:=T(BBB\ldots\mbox{ k copies }\ldots BD)=4k+20.
\\]

The expectation
\begin{align}
E[T] &=\sum_{k=0}^\infty t_k\times P(T=t_k)\\\\\
&=\sum_{k=0}^\infty (4k+20)\times P(T=t_k)\\\\\
&=\sum_{k=0}^\infty 4k\times P(T=t_k)+\sum_{k=0}^\infty 20\times P(T=t_k)\\\\\
&=4\sum_{k=0}^\infty k\times P(T=t_k)+20\times1\\\\\
&=4\sum_{k=0}^\infty k\times(0.4)^k\times0.6+20\\\\\
&=4\times0.6\times0.4\left(\sum_{k=0}^\infty k(0.4)^{k-1}\right)+20\\\\\
&=4\times0.6\times0.4\sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{d}{dp}\Biggr\rvert_{p=0.4}\left(p^k\right)+20\\\\\
&=4\times0.6\times0.4\times\frac{d}{dp}\Biggr\rvert_{p=0.4}\left(\sum_{k=0}^\infty p^k\right)+20\\\\\
&=4\times0.6\times0.4\times\frac{d}{dp}\Biggr\rvert_{p=0.4}\left(\frac{1}{1-p}\right)+20\\\\\
&=4\times0.6\times0.4\left[\frac{1}{(1-p)^2}\right]\Biggr\rvert_{p=0.4}+20\\\\\
&=4\times0.6\times0.4\left(\frac{1}{0.6^2}\right)+20\\\\\
&=4\times0.4\left(\frac{1}{0.6}\right)+20\\\\\
&=22.66
\end{align}
