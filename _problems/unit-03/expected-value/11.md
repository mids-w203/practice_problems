    a) Let $X$ be a discrete random variable with a PMF symmetric about $c$, i.e., 
    $P(X=c-x)=P(X=c+x)$ for all $x\in Supp[X]$. Show that $E[X]=c$.

    b) Let $X$ be a continuous random variable with a PDF $f_X$ symmetric about $c$, i.e.,
    $f_X(c-x)=f_X(c+x)$ for all $x\in\mathbb{R}$. Show that $E[X]=c$.
