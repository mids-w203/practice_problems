    Suppose that a group of six hunters are out in a duck blind when twelve ducks fly overhead.  Each of the hunters picks one duck at random to aim
    at. Their shot hits the duck and kills it with probability 0.6.   

    (a) What is the mean number of ducks that are killed?  
    (b) What is the expected number of hunters who hit the duck they aim at?
