    Sic Bo is an ancient Chinese dice game played with three dice. One of the
    possibilities for betting in the game is to bet “big.” For this bet, you win if the
    total $X$ is 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, or 17, except when there are three 4’s or three
    5’s. On a \\$1 bet on big, you win \\$1 plus your dollar back if it happens. What is
    your expected value?
