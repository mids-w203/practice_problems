    Five people play a game of “odd one out” to determine who will pay for the pizza they ordered. Each flips a coin. If only one person gets heads (or tails) while the other four get tails (or heads) then he is the odd one and has to pay. Otherwise they flip again. What is the expected number of tosses needed to determine who will pay?
---
For each (collective) toss of five (fair) coins, we call it a SUCCESS (S) if it determines who will pay, i.e., exactly one coin lands on HEADS and the other on TAILS. And, we call it a FAILURE (F) if any other combination of HEADS and TAILS shows up. We first compute $P(S)$. Out of $2^5=32$ possible combinations, $S$ can happen only in the following ways: $HTTTT,THTTT,TTHTT,TTTHT,TTTTH,THHHH,HTHHH,HHTHH,HHHTH,HHHHT$.
So,
\\[
P(S)=\frac{10}{32}=\frac{5}{16}\mbox{, consequently }P(F)=\frac{11}{16}.
\\]

Now, such collective tosses are performed *independently* until the first SUCCESS. In order to decide who pays for the pizza, the following *infinite* sample space is generated:

$$
\Omega=\{S,FS,FFS,FFFS,\ldots\}.
$$

Since each collective toss is performed independently, for a generic outcome $\omega\in\Omega$ with $n$ collective tosses, we compute
$P(\omega)=$

$$
P(\underbrace{FFF\ldots F}_{(n-1) \mbox{ failures}}S)=\left(\frac{11}{16}\right)^{n-1}\times\frac{5}{16}.
$$

Let $X$ denote the random variable on $\Omega$ that counts the number of collective tosses for each $\omega\in\Omega$, then the expectation

$$
\begin{align}
E[X]&=\sum_{n=1}^\infty n P(X=n)\\\\\
&=\sum_{n=1}^\infty n\left(\frac{11}{16}\right)^{n-1}\times\frac{5}{16}\\\\\
&=\frac{5}{16}\sum_{n=1}^\infty n\left(\frac{11}{16}\right)^{n-1}\\\\\
&=\frac{5}{16}\sum_{n=1}^\infty\frac{d}{dr}\Biggr\rvert_{r=\frac{11}{16}}\left(r^n\right)\\\\\
&=\frac{5}{16}\frac{d}{dr}\Biggr\rvert_{r=\frac{11}{16}}\left(\sum_{n=0}^\infty r^n-1\right)\\\\\
&=\frac{5}{16}\frac{d}{dr}\Biggr\rvert_{r=\frac{11}{16}}\left(\frac{1}{1-r}-1\right)\\\\\
&=\frac{5}{16}\frac{1}{(1-r)^2}\Biggr\rvert_{r=\frac{11}{16}}\\\\\
&=\frac{5}{16}\left[\frac{1}{(1-\frac{11}{16})^2}\right]\\\\\
&=\frac{5}{16}\left[\frac{16}{5}\right]^2\\\\\
&=\frac{16}{5}\\\\\
&=3.2
\end{align}
$$

The expected number of tosses required is $3.2$.
