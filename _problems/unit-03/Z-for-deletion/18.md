    Five people play a game of “odd one out” to determine who will pay for the pizza they ordered. Each flips a coin. If only one person gets heads (or tails) while the other four get tails (or heads) then he is the odd one and has to pay. Otherwise they flip again. What is the expected number of tosses needed to determine who will pay?

For each (collective) toss of five (fair) coins, we call it a SUCCESS (S) if it determines who will pay, i.e., exactly one coin lands on HEADS and the other on TAILS. And, we call it a FAILURE (F) if any other combination of HEADS and TAILS shows up. We first compute $P(S)$. Out of $2^5=32$ possible combinations, $S$ can happen only in the following ways: $HTTTT,THTTT,TTHTT,TTTHT,TTTTH,THHHH,HTHHH,HHTHH,HHHTH,HHHHT$.
So,
$$P(S)=\frac{10}{32}=\frac{5}{16}$$

Now, such collective tosses are performed *independently* until the first SUCCESS. This is a common situation known as Bernoulli trials. Moreover, there is a well-known distribution (shown in the async) that is relevant here. A geometric distribution describes the number of trials until the first success. You can look at the wikipedia page to remind yourself of the expectation, which is given by $1/P(S) = \frac{16}{5}$.
