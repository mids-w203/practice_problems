statement: |
    Suppose $X$ takes on the values $−2, −1, 0, 1, 2$ with probability $1/5$ each, and let $Y=X^2 $.  
    (a) Find $COV [X,Y]$.   
    (b) Are $X$ and $Y$ independent?

The lesson: This problem is supposed to drive in the fact that zero correlation does not mean that there's no relationship between 2 variables. It's true that if you have no relationship, you will have zero correlation, but that rule only goes one way.

Part a

\\[
    \begin{align}
    \text{Thrm 2.2.2}\\\\\
    Cov[X,Y] &= E[XY] - E[X]E[Y] \\\\\
    &= E[X(X^2)] - E[X]E[X^2]\\\\\
        \end{align}
\\]

\\[
    \begin{align}
    \text{Thrm 2.1.1}\\\\\
    E[X] &= \sum_x xf(x)\\\\\
         &= (-2)*0.2 + (-1)*0.2 + 0*0.2 + 1*0.2 + 2*0.2 \\\\\
         &= 0\\\\\
    \end{align}
\\]


Part b)

We can just note that by inspection that $Y$ is dependent on $X$. Specifically, $Y$ is equal to $X^2$, so not only do we know that they are not independent, we know the exact function that makes $Y$ dependent on $X$. 

Alternatively, we can show lack of independence using Definition 1.3.16 from the book. That definition says that variables $X$ and $Y$ are independent if their joint probability distribuion $f(x,y)$ and the individual marginal distributions $f_Y(y)$ and $f_X(x)$ are related by the equation: $f(x,y) = f(x)f(y)$. We can see below that this is not how they are related in our joint distribution function.
