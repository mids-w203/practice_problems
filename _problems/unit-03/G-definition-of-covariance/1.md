    Suppose $X$ takes on the values $−2, −1, 0, 1, 2$ with probability $1/5$ each, and let $Y=X^2 $.  
    (a) Find $COV [X,Y]$.   
    (b) Are $X$ and $Y$ independent?

The lesson: This problem is supposed to drive in the fact that zero correlation does not mean that there's no relationship between 2 variables. It's true that if you have no relationship, you will have zero correlation, but that rule only goes one way.

Part a)
$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{Thrm 2.2.2}\\
Cov[X,Y] &= E[XY] - E[X]E[Y] \\
&=E[X(X^2)] - E[X]E[X^2]\\
\\
\text{Thrm 2.1.1}\\
E[X] &= \sum_x xf(x)\\
     &= (-2)*0.2 + (-1)*0.2 + 0*0.2 + 1*0.2 + 2*0.2 \\
     &= 0\\
\\
\text{Thrm 2.1.5} & \; \text{(LOTUS)} \\
E[X^2] &= \sum_x g(x)f(x)\\
       &= 4*0.2 + 1*0.2 + 0*0.2 + 1*0.2 + 4*0.2 \\
       &= 2\\
\\
E[X^3] &= \sum_x g(x)f(x)\\
       &= (-8)*0.2 + (-1)*0.2 + 0*0.2 + 1*0.2 + 8*0.2 \\
       &= 0\\
\\
\text{Plug in}\\
Cov[X,Y] &= 0 - 0*2\\
         &= 0
\end{aligned}
$$

Part b)

We can just note that by inspection Y is dependent on $X$. Specifically, $Y$ is equal to $X^2$, so not only do we know that they are not independent, we know the exact function that makes $Y$ dependent on $X$. Alternatively, we can use the rule from definition 1.3.16

|      |$f_X(-2)=0.2$ | X=-1 | X = 0 | X=1 | X=2 |
|------|--------------|-------|-------|------|-----|
|Y=0   |              |       |       |      |     | 
|Y=1   |              |       |       |      |     | 
|Y   |              |       |       |      |     |
