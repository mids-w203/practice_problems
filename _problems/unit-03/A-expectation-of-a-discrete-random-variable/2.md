    You want to invent a gambling game in which a person rolls two dice and is paid some money if the sum is $7$, but otherwise he loses his money. How much should you pay him for winning a \\$1 bet if you want this to be a fair game, that is, to have expected value $0$?
answer: $6$

Let $c$ be that amount I should pay a player in order to make the game fair. Let us also denote by $X$ the random variable that registers the amount a player wins. Then the support of $X=\{c-1,-1\}$. For this game, $\|\Omega\|=36$, so $$P(X=c-1)=P(\mbox{the sum is } 7)=P(\{(1,6),(6,1),(2,5),(5,2),(3,4),(4,3)\})=\frac{6}{36}=\frac{1}{6}.$$

Also,  $$P(X=-1)=P(\mbox{the sum is not } 7)=1-\frac{1}{6}=\frac{5}{6}.$$

Therefore, $$E[X]=(c-1)\times\frac{1}{6}+(-1)\times\frac{5}{6}=\frac{c-6}{6}.$$

In order for $E[X]$ to be $0$, $c$ has to be $6$.
