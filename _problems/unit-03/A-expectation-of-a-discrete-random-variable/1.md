    A gambler plays roulette and bets \\$1 on black 19 times. They wins \\$1 with probability
    18/38 and loses \\$1 with probability 20/38. What are the expected winnings?
---
The 19 plays yield outcomes which are independent of one another.

Let $Y_i$ be a random variable representing the payoff for game $i$, where $i \in \\{1,2,...,19\\}$.

From the problem description, we can write,

$$
P(Y=y) = \begin{cases} \frac{18}{38}, &y = \$ 1\\\\ \frac{20}{38}, &y = \$ -1 \\\\ 0, &otherwise\end{cases}
$$

The Expected Value notated as $E[Y]=$

$$1*\frac{18}{38} + -1*\frac{20}{38} = \$ -0.053$$

Let $Z$ be a random variable defined as 

$$
Z = \sum_{i=1}^{19} Y_i
$$

Then

$$
E[Z] = E[\sum_{i=1}^{19} Y(i)]
$$

By the linear operator property of expected value, we have

$$
E[Z(19)]  = \sum_{i=1}^{19} E[Y(i)]
$$

Substituting the expectation we computed above,

$$
E[Z]  = \sum_{i=1}^{19} -0.053 = 19*(-0.053) = \$ -1
$$

Which is the desired expected value.
