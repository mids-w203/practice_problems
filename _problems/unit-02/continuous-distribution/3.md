    Let $F(x)=3x-2x^2$ for $0\leq x\leq1$, $F(x)=0$ for $x\leq0$, and $F(x)=1$ for $x\geq1$. Is $F$ a distribution function? If so, find its density function.

We know a lot of things! And, we know them about cumulative density functions. 

First, we know that when evaluated at the high limit of the support $F(x) = 1$, and when evaluated at the low limit of the support $F(x) = 0$. We also know that $F(x)$ is a monotonically increasing function -- it never decreases. This is going to turn out to be the important part of this solution. 

We might suggest that you graph this on the support of the random variable. But, the other way to check whether this is monotonically increasing is to take its derivative and look for areas in the derivative that evaluate to a negative value. 

$$
\begin{aligned}
  \frac{d}{dx} F(x) &= \frac{d}{dx} 3x-2x^2 \\ 
	  &= 3 - 4x
\end{aligned}
$$

We can notice quickly that there is an inflection point at $x=\frac{3}{4}$, and a quick spot-evaluation (without even using any further calculus identities) shows that for $\frac{3}{4} \leq x \leq 1$ this function is decreasing. And so, it does not meet the definition of a valid cdf.
