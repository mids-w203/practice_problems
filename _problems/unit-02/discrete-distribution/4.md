    Suppose that every time a person goes to the pet-shelter, they have a 50% chance of taking home a dog and a 50% chance of taking home a cat. How many times does a person need to go to the pet-shelter to so that the probability that they have both a dog and a cat is $\geq0.95$?

The problem assumes that the probability of the $i$-th adoption being a dog, or a cat is $\frac{1}{2}$. The problem also assumes that the events that the $i$-th and  the $j$-th adoption are male are *statistically independent* for $i\neq j$. If the pet adopter plans to have $n$ pets and $A$ denotes the event that they have both a dog and a cat, then

$$A'=\\{\underbrace{MMM\ldots}\_{n}, \underbrace{MMM\ldots}\_{n}\\}.$$

Using the addition rule and the independence assumption,  we get 
$$P(A')=P(\underbrace{MMM\ldots}\_{n})+P( \underbrace{MMM\ldots}\_{n})=\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^n+\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^n=2\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^n.$$

Now, we have
\\[
\begin{align}
&P(A)\geq0.95\\\\\
\implies&1-P(A')\geq0.95\\\\\
\implies&P(A')\leq0.05\\\\\
\implies&2\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^n\leq0.05\\\\\
\implies&\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^n\leq0.025\\\\\
\implies&n\log{\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)}\leq\log{0.025}\\\\\
\implies&n\geq5.32.
\end{align}
\\]

Therefore, the pet-adopter should plan to adopt at least $\lceil n\rceil=6$ pets.
