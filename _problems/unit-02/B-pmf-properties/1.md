    What value of $c$ makes the following a valid probability mass function?
    $$f(x) = \begin{cases} c, &x \in \{1,2\}\\\\ 2c, &x \in \{5\}\\\\ 0, &otherwise \end{cases}$$
answer: 0.25

From Thrm 1.2.9 we have the following:
\\[
    \sum_{x \in X(\Omega)} f(x) = 1
\\]

When we apply this to our specific equation we get the following:

\\[
    \begin{align}
    1 &= \sum_{x \in 1,2,5} f(x)
      &= f(1) + f(2) + f(5)
      &= c + c + 2c
      &= 4c
    c &= 1/4 = 0.25
    \end{align}
\\]
