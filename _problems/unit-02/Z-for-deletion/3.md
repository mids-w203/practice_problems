index: 3
statement: |
    We roll two six-sided dice, one with sides $1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4$ and the other with sides $1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8$. What is the distribution of the sum?

Like other questions of this type, the easiest way for me (ahem, Alex...) to think about this is using a table. 

Since these are dice, we can infer from our real-world understanding that the die are independent from each other. Let's make a table where Die 1 is on the rows, and Die 2 is on the columns. 

|     |1          | 3           | 4        | 5         | 6         | 8        | Marginal | 
|---|-------|--------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------------|
| 1 | 1/36 | 1/36 | 1/36 | 1/36 | 1/36 | 1/36 | 6/36           |  
| 2 | 2/36 | 2/36 | 2/36 | 2/36 | 2/36 | 2/36 | 12/36        | 
| 3 | 2/36 | 2/36 | 2/36 | 2/36 | 2/36 | 2/36 | 12/36        | 
| 4 | 1/36 | 1/36 | 1/36 | 1/36 | 1/36 | 1/36 | 6/36           |  
|Marginal|1/6|1/6|1/6|1/6|1/6|1/6|

However, this does not provide the sum of the random variables. In order to get to the sum, we need to... actually produce those sums. Since each of these cells are independent of all others, we can get to this quite ~~easily~~ tediously. 

| Value    | Probability |   
|---|---|
| 2              | 1/36 | 
| 3              | 2/36 | 
| 4              | 3/36 | 
| 5              | 4/36 | 
| 6              | 5/36 | 
| 7              | 6/36 | 
| 8              | 5/36 | 
| 9              | 4/36 | 
| 10           | 3/36 |
| 11           | 2/36 | 
| 12           | 1/36 |
