    Let X :== as a Random Variable representing the number of heads in four independent flips of a fair coin.

    1. Provide in bracket notation the pmf of X;
    2. Compute the probability that X is equal to an odd number;
    3. Provide in bracket notion the cdf of X

Let $Y$ be a bernoulli random variable defined such that each flip

$$   
Y= \\{ T, H \\} :== \\{ 0, 1 \\} \text{, where T :== Tails and H :== Heads}
$$


$$
P(Y = y) = 
\begin{cases} 
0.5, &y = 0 \\
0.5, &y = 1 \\
0, & \text{otherwise} 
\end{cases}
$$

Let $X$ be a random variable =  number of Heads (defined as 1's) in four independent flips of a fair coin, e.g. four bernoulli trials

$$ 
X = \sum_{i=1}^{4} Y(i)\
$$

$$
\Rightarrow \text{ X can take on the values } \\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4\\} \text{ heads.}
$$

To construct the pdf for $X$ let's compute the probability for possible value of $X = x$
