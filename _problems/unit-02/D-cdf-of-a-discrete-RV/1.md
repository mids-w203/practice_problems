    Let X :== as a Random Variable representing the number of heads in four independent flips of a fair coin.

    1. Provide in bracket notation the pmf of X;
    2. Compute the probability that X is equal to an odd number;
    3. Provide in bracket notion the cdf of X

Let $Y$ be a bernoulli random variable defined such that each flip

$$   
Y= \\{ T, H \\} :== \\{ 0, 1 \\} \text{, where T :== Tails and H :== Heads}
$$


$$
P(Y = y) = 
\begin{cases} 
0.5, &y = 0 \\
0.5, &y = 1 \\
0, & \text{otherwise} 
\end{cases}
$$

Let $X$ be a random variable =  number of Heads (defined as 1's) in four independent flips of a fair coin, e.g. four bernoulli trials

$$ 
X = \sum_{i=1}^{4} Y(i)\
$$

$$
\Rightarrow \text{ X can take on the values } \\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4\\} \text{ heads.}
$$

To construct the pmf for $X$ let's compute the probability for possible value of $X = x$

<div align="center">
    
| Number of H, X=x |  P(X=x) as formula    | P(X=x) as value |
|:----------------:|:---------------------:|:---------------:|
|        0         |$$\( \binom{4}{0} \times 0.5^0 \times 0.5^4 \)$$|   0.0625    |
|        1         |$$\( \binom{4}{1} \times 0.5^1 \times 0.5^3 \)$$|   0.25      |
|        2         |$$\( \binom{4}{2} \times 0.5^2 \times 0.5^2 \)$$|   0.375     |
|        3         |$$\( \binom{4}{3} \times 0.5^3 \times 0.5^1 \)$$|   0.25      |
|        4         |$$\( \binom{4}{4} \times 0.5^4 \times 0.5^0 \)$$|   0.0625    |

As a check on this table, if represents a legitimate pmf for $X$, we see that for all values making up the supp($X$) the probabilities are greater than 0 and the sum of the probabilities is = 1.

So, the soution to part 1 is

$$
\Rightarrow  X \in \\{ 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 \\} \text{, the pmf in bracket notation is: }
$$

$$
P(X=x) = \begin{cases} 0.0625, &x = 0\\\\ 0.25, &x = 1\\\\ 0.375, &x = 2\\\\ 0.25, &x = 3\\\\ 0.0625, &x = 4\\\\ 0, &otherwise\end{cases}
$$

For part 2 ...

$$
P(\text{ X is odd }) \Rightarrow P(\text{ X = 1 or X = 3 }) =
\text{ (By Independence)  } P(X = 1) + P( X = 3)  = 0.5
$$
