    Suppose $X$ has density function $f(x)=x/2$ for $0<x<2$ and $0$ otherwise.
    Find 

    (a) the cumulative distribution function, 
     
    (b) $P(X<1)$, 

    (c) $P(X>3/2)$
---
a) The CDF is found by taking the integral of the density starting at negative infinity.
Let F(x) be the CDF of X. Based on the given information, $F(x) = 0$ for $x \le 0$.  
For $x \ge 0$, $F(x)$ can be found as the following    

$$\begin{aligned}
F(x)&= \int_{-\infty}^x \frac{u}{2}du \\\\
&= \int_{-\infty}^0 f(u)du + \int_{0}^x f(u)du \\\\
&= 0 + \int_{0}^{x}\frac{u}{2}du\\\\
&= \frac{x^2}{4}
\\end{aligned}$$

(b) $$\begin{aligned}
P(X<1) = F(1) = \frac{1^2}{4} = \frac{1}{4}
\end{aligned}$$

(c) $$\begin{aligned}
P(X>\frac{3}{2}) &= 1 - P(X \le \frac{3}{2})  \\\\
&= 1-F(\frac{3}{2})\\\\
&= 1-\frac{9}{16} = \frac{7}{16}
\\end{aligned}$$
