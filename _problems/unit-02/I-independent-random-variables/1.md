    Fill in the rest of the joint distribution so that $X$ and $Y$ are independent. There are two possible answers:

    |$Y$|$X=0$|$1$|
    |---|---|---|
    |$0$|$?$|$\frac{2}{9}$|
    |$1$|$\frac{2}{9}$|$?$|

Let us consider the following probabilities:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $P(X=0, Y=0) = a$
    \item $P(X=1, Y=1) = b$
\end{itemize}

From these, we can deduce:
\begin{align*}
    P(X=0) &= a + \frac{2}{9} = P(Y=0) \\
    P(X=1) &= \frac{2}{9} + b = P(Y=1)
\end{align*}

Now, if we assume that $X$ and $Y$ are independent variables, then the joint probabilities can be expressed as the product of their individual probabilities. Therefore, we have:
\begin{align*}
    P(X=0, Y=0) &= P(X=0) \cdot P(Y=0) \\
    a &= (a + \frac{2}{9})^2
\end{align*}
Expanding and rearranging this equation, we obtain a quadratic equation:
\begin{align*}
    a^2 + \frac{4}{81} - \frac{5}{9}a &= 0
\end{align*}
Solving this quadratic equation, we find that $a$ can be either $\frac{1}{9}$ or $\frac{4}{9}$.

Similarly, for $b$, we have:
\begin{align*}
    P(X=1, Y=1) &= P(X=1) \cdot P(Y=1) \\
    b &= (\frac{2}{9} + b)^2
\end{align*}
This simplifies to the same quadratic equation as for $a$, yielding the solutions $b = \frac{1}{9}$ or $b = \frac{4}{9}$.

Considering all possible combinations of $a$ and $b$ that satisfy the independence requirement, we find two viable pairs:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $a = \frac{1}{9}, b = \frac{4}{9}$
    \item $a = \frac{4}{9}, b = \frac{1}{9}$
\end{itemize}

These pairs represent the solutions under the assumption of independence between $X$ and $Y$.
