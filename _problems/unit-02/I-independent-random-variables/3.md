caption: Can Independence Carry Through?
statement: |
    The following statements are either true or false.  Prove them or provide a counterexample:

    1. If X, Y, and Z are random variables, X and Y are independent, Y and Z are independent, then X and Z must be independent.

    2. If X, Y, and Z are random variables, X and Y are not independent, Y and Z are not independent, then X and Z must be not independent.
answer: 1. False, 2. False
---

**1. Proof by counterexample:**

Imagine that we have $2$ fair coins, coin A and coin B. We define several random variables based on the outcome of these coins. 

- $X$ takes on value of $0$ for tails in coin A, $1$ for heads in coin A
- $Y$ takes on value of $0$ for tails in coin B, $1$ for heads in coin B
- $Z$ takes on value of $0$ for tails in coin A, $1$ for heads in coin A

It can be seen that $X$ and $Z$ will always have exactly the same outcome. They are therefore **not indpendent**
However, we can also see that since coin A is indpendent of coin B, $X \perp Y$ and $Y \perp Z$.

Therefore supposition 1 is **False**

**2. Proof by counterexample:**

We can imagine we have $2$ fair coins, coin A and coin B

From these $2$ coins we define $3$ random variables

- $X$ takes on value of $0$ for tails in coin A, $1$ for heads in coin A
- $Z$ takes on value of $0$ for tails in coin B, $1$ for heads in coin B
- $Y$ takes on the value of the sum of $X$ and $Y$

By inspection $X$ and $Z$ are independent of each other. $Y$ and $X$ are not independent niether are $Y$ and $Z$. 

Therefore supposition 2 is **False**

<!--
I actually ended up showing that X and Y are not independent in the case below, so if the lack
of independence is because X and Z are dependent on Y then X and Z will not be independent.

Imagine that we have $5$ coins. $3$ of these coins ($A$, $B$, and $C$) are fair with a pmf of:

\\[
    f(x) = \begin{cases}
        0.5 & x = 0\\\\\
        0.5 & x = 1 \\\\\
        0 & otherwise
    \end{cases}
\\]

$2$ of these coins  ($D$ and $E$) are unfair with a pmf of:

\\[
    f(x) = \begin{cases}
        0.3 & x = 0\\\\\
        0.7 & x = 1 \\\\\
        0 & otherwise
    \end{cases}
\\]

In all cases **0 corresponds to tails, 1 corresponds to heads** on the coin

Our random variables $X$, $Y$, and $Z$ are defined as follows:

- $Y$ is the outcome of coin $A$
- $X$ is the outcome of coin $B$ in the case where $Y$ is $1$ and it is the outcome of coin $D$ in the case where $Y$ is $0$
- $Z$ is the outcome of coin $C$ in the case where $Y$ is $1$ and it is the outcome of coin $E$ in the case where $Y$ is $0$

By inspection we see that $X$ and $Y$ are not independent since 
the outcome of $Y$ directly affects the distribution of $X$. A 
similar line of logic means that $Y$ and $Z$ are not independent.

f((x,z)|y=0)

|          |f_X(0)=0.5|f_X(1)=0.5|
|----------|----------|----------|
|f_Z(0)=0.5| 0.25     | 0.25     |
|f_Z(1)=0.5| 0.25     | 0.25     |


f((x,z)|y=1)

|          |f_X(0)=0.3|f_X(1)=0.7|
|----------|----------|----------|
|f_Z(0)=0.3| 0.09     | 0.21     |
|f_Z(1)=0.7| 0.21     | 0.49     |


We can combine them by taking each part and weighting them by 0.5 to build the f((x,z)) table 
below. We can see the table below is **not** indpendent because f(x,y) != f(x)f(y)

|          |f_X(0)=0.4|f_X(1)=0.6|
|----------|----------|----------|
|f_Z(0)=0.4| 0.17     | 0.23     |
|f_Z(1)=0.6| 0.23     | 0.37     |
