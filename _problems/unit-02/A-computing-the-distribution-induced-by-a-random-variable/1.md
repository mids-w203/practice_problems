    Suppose outcome space $\Omega = \[1,2,3,4,5,6\}$ represents a 6-sided die, and the probability function assigns probability $1/6$ to each outcome. Let random variable $X: \Omega \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ be defined as, 
    
    $$X(x) = \begin{cases} 1, &x \le 2\\ 2, &otherwise\end{cases}$$
    
Compute the pmf of $X$
